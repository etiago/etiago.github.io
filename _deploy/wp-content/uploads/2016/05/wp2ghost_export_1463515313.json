It is Safe\u2026 but it is a bit inconvenient for those who have no knowledge of what the program is about.\n\nBecause of all this, and at the request of a friend of mine, I decided to develop this very friendly application, both in its name as well as on its ease of use, and its graphical environment.\n\nFor those who did not know SafeSex, this application allows us to store text notes for later access; an improved notepad of sorts. SafeSex leaves us a small rectangle on our desktop and you just have to click it in order to get to your notes.\n\nLet us now go onto the technical details. TeddyBearNotes was developed upon the .NET Framework 3.5, using C# as the language. The notes are stored in the hard drive in an XML file and they can be optionally encrypted. The encryption resorts to a widely known algorithm, the AES (also known as the Rijndael algorithm) which is also the algorithm used by the North-American government.\n\nTeddyBearNotes also allows you to have it boot up automatically with Windows and it also gives you the possibility of completely customizing the window where you write your notes.\n\nAs far as licensing goes, this program is open-source and distributed under the BSD license (read the file inside the source code package). It is therefore possible to redistribute the code as long as the original license file is kept, with the due credits to myself.\n\nI think I have not missed anything so I will leave here the temporary download links.

Some people admittedly use it [more than others](http:\/\/web.mit.edu\/cms\/bcc\/blogpics\/postit.jpg) but we have all used them. They are very handy and at really busy times, we humans have a knack for forgetting things, thus there is the need to note down stuff.However, post-its use up space, either stuck to your monitor screen or messed up around your desk, and let us face it: nowadays, if you have a desk, it is very likely that you have a PC. If you do, you came to the right place.\n\nThe question I am going to ask you is: if you wanted to write a note for yourself right now on a post-it, what would you have to do? You would probably have to search for your post-it stash, then find a pen that actually still does its job (and we all know how hard that is\u2026) and only then write your notes down, only to be limited by a really small writing area.\n\nWhat if I told you that you could have a (friendly-looking) icon in your system tray (that zone next to the clock on your Windows start bar), where you just have to click it to have a fully customizable text box show up? Even better, what if that text box instantly vanishes as soon as you resume the work you were doing on your computer, safely encrypting the notes in your hard drive with a world renowned algorithm, effectively keeping your notes secure?\n\nIt sounds good so far? Well keep reading!\n\nImagine this scenario: your office or your home gets broken into. Tough luck. You had post-its all over your computer monitor, with your passwords for your online banking, for your instant messaging services, for your e-mail, for your online DMV access, and now it\u2019s all gone. The thieves stole your computer altogether and it is all in their hands now. You have to go through all the hassle of changing all your passwords.\n\nWhat if you were using TeddyBear Notes? Not by a slim chance would they have access to your stuff! Not only can you store a limit-less amount of information in it but you can choose to encrypt the notes! Do you know which encryption algorithm TeddyBear Notes uses? You do not need to be a genius to know this: it uses the [AES algorithm](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Advanced_Encryption_Standard), also widely known as the Rijndael algorithm. Heck, that is the algorithm used by the US government! We all know how the North-Americans value their security so whilst I do not know the inner workings of the algorithm (I am not a mathmatician), I certainly trust what is one of the most secure algorithms out there.\n\nYou cannot go wrong with this little application. TeddyBear Notes is lightweight, it has a really really small footprint on your computer\u2019s memory and you can customize it. No longer will you have to stick with boring yellow post-its. Are you a girly girl with a passion for pink? Great!

It is and and <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">absolutely free<\/span> and <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">open-source<\/span>! Just like Linux, to name an example. Now, when was the last time you heard of someone using Linux and getting hacked or catching viruses? You probably have never heard about it. The big advantage of using open-source software is that it is not just my eyes (the developer\u2019s) that are ensuring that this application is safe, instead, it is the eyes of hundreds of programmers all around the world! Simply because the code is available for everyone to download and have a look. Doesn\u2019t this make TeddyBear Notes unsafe, you ask? Not in the slightest. The safest algorithms and programs in the world are all open-source (including AES) and the reason for that is what I just mentioned: they are being proofed by thousands of people all around the world. Besides, your notes are encrypted with an algorithm through the means of a <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">password<\/span>. Without that password, tough luck for hackers. It would take decades worth of really massive computing to crack your notes specifically, and another whole lot of decades to crack anyone else\u2019s.\n\nDo you like what you see? Wonderful. This post is my introduction post to TeddyBear Notes, so essentially all you have to do is go to [www.tiagoespinha.net](www.tiagoespinha.net) and then click the tag \u201cteddybearnotes\u201d on the right-hand menu.

This application is now quite outdated so use it at your own peril, and feel free to contribute code for it.\n\nI have a BSc from the School of Technology and Management of Leiria (ESTG Leiria)\u00a0in Informatics[sic] Engineering. My major (known as branch in the Portuguese naming system) is in Information Systems. Since I always strive to be the best at what I do, I felt that my education was a little short to have significance in the labor market; with that said, I went to the UK in September 2009 where I have obtained my Master\u2019s degree in Advanced Software Engineering at the University of Leicester.

The basic notion is that you are paid to watch a set of advertisement links for a certain period of time. After you do so, you get a credit of a few dollar cents in your account and additionally, when you reach a certain minimum amount of balance in your account you can ask for a checkout.\n\nNow, when I said a few dollar cents, it really is a few dollar cents, as in usually you get paid $0.01 for each page-view which is a pretty meagre amount. Add this to the fact that at best, you get 10 to 20 ad-links to click upon (this varies between PTC systems) and it does not take a genius to do the math and know that you will not be making that much profit out of this system.\n\nSo why is it so widespread and why do people adhere to these systems so massively?\n\nMostly because there is more to it. All of the pay to click systems have a referal system. Actually, this is what keeps them in business.\n\nReferrals work in the following way: for each referral I have, I will also earn a certain amount of money for each click they make. On some PTCs this amount is actually the same as the amount I get for my own clicks, but on some systems this amount is downsized.\n\nTypically it will be hard to find a decent amount of referrals. It will be hard to find an amount big enough to actually render you more than just one or two dozens of dollars, but once again, most or all the PTC systems have a system to fight this: a referral market. Basically, you just buy referrals for money, and then it will be like if those referrals had in fact registered on that PTC site with your name as their referral. Do you see where this is getting now?\n\nLet us consider the following scenario: you are consistently getting 5 ad-links per day, each will give you $0.01, so you on your own make $0.05 per day. Now, you had some spare money and bought 1000 referrals. Each of those referrals will also have the 5 links and they will also click on them; as a result, for each click, it will be as if you had clicked as well, so on the first day here\u2019s how much you will make:\n\n5 * 0.01 * 1000 = $50\n\nSounds better than a simple $0.05 per day, does it not? With an income like that, you can expect something in the order of $1500 per month, give or take.\n\nMaybe at this point some people who did not know about pay to click systems are jumping up and down, wanting to take the plunge and jump right into *the scene*, but I am sure that many other readers will be skeptical. I know that the first question that came to my mind when I was introduced to this system was: where does the money come from?\n\nEasy. It comes from advertisers who pay a fee to the PTC systems, so that they will publish their advertisements as part of the ad-links. Usually the advertisers pay an amount per page-views (i.e. per amount of times their link was clicked) which is just slightly higher than the amount of money that we, clickers, get for clicking \u2013 allowing for huge profit for PTC owners.\n\nSo now that you know their source of income, are you still skeptic? If you are, you are rightfully so. The essential fail on these systems is how saturated the web is with them; so much that the advertisers are in fact\u2026. **other PTC companies!** No matter how much you look around, you will always find that PTC Site A has ad-links for PTC sites B, C and D \u2013 and the site B has links for A, C and D and so on\u2026 So in reality, this is actually a mangle of websites linking to one another, using profits of theirs to feed the profits of their \u201copponents\u201d and we get to a point where we are recycling money between companies, in a very closed system, where the only fresh money that gets in, **is actually money put in by *clickers***.\n\nWhy don\u2019t real, honest, business companies want to advertise in PTC websites? Simple: whoever is in the PTC deal as a clicker, simply isn\u2019t in it for watching the ads. People will click the ad, keep browsing until the timer runs down, then close that tab, click the next ad and continue the process. This simply does **not** serve the purpose of advertising. Companies advertise their products in the hopes of increasing their sales, because people will look at their ads and feel the urge to buy their products or to subscribe their services. This simply does not happen when people are in it for the money!\n\nIt is somewhat transitive: people click the ads but do not buy. Since people do not buy, the companies do not get the expected income. Let us face it, when a company invests X money in advertising, they are expecting an income of X+Y where they get back the amount they spent, plus a profit. If this profit does not appear, the companies will be less inclined towards advertising and they stop publishing their ads and it all crumbles like a building being demolished.\n\nThis is the crux of the PTC systems having failed over and over and over. They are doomed to fail because the notion is flawed to begin with. The punch-line is: why being advertised at for free, whilst you can be get paid to watch advertisements?\n\nWell, this is all really pretty, but you will never be looking at ads from real companies like Microsoft, Yahoo, Google or even of popular online games like World of Warcraft or EvE Online. Instead, you will be looking at ads from companies who also make a living out of PTC deals.\n\nSo yeah, I am indeed registered on a few PTC sites and I do click regularly on all of them, but at this point, they are all self-managed. I get profit from PTC, I use it to buy referrals and hopefully at some point I will be leeching the money of people who have invested and given up. Truth is that to make big bucks in this sort of business, you must have big bucks to start with, and they must be disposable. It must be something like venture capital; money that you can simply lose, because there is a high risk involved. There is a risk of it not paying out as well as you expected, or simply the risk of the PTC company going bankrupt and then you have nothing. It has happened the past, many many companies in this field have gone belly-up and then, all those who had invested the big bucks are all of a sudden wiped out.\n\nObviously, if the company lives long enough for you to make enough profit, so that it gets to be auto-recyclable, then it might be a good deal, but still with a very risky launching pad.\n\nSo, in sum, it really isn\u2019t worth it unless you invest at least some money and if you do invest, do be ready to lose the money. You might hit jackpot in the long run, but the most likely ending is that you get no profit and you say goodbye to your money. Truth is: it is not something you can live from. If you had the starting money so that it could become good enough to live from it, then you are probably rich enough to not need this sort of programs to make a living and you will stay out of it.\n\nThis is the core of pay to click websites, although there are some new services out there coming up with new innovative strategies that at a first glance, they all look like perfect ways to get more money. Still, none change the fact that these systems are all like a closed environment. Very little money gets in and tons of money seem to be getting out, not to mention the profit that the companies involved make.\n\nTo finalize, if you want to make really good money, start your own pay to click service and when you have a few thousand bucks in balance, run away with it and never show up again \ud83d\ude1b otherwise, you might join the few poor ones and help out a bloke by trying out the service. These two services seem to be the most credible and faster payers out there. Be careful though, do not join every PTC service out there. Services like bux.to are simply a no-go due to it taking months from the time you ask for your money until you actually get it.\n\nSo if you want to give it a try, just click on these banners and get started.

Well that is not what [this](http:\/\/www.tomshardware.com\/reviews\/Atom-Athlon-Efficient,1997.html) review by Tom\u2019s Hardware shows us. It is true that the Core 2 platform has [smashed](http:\/\/www.pcadvisor.co.uk\/news\/index.cfm?newsid=12061) the competition from AMD on pretty much every front of the market, but this tide might be about to turn.\n\nWith the recent [outbreak of netbook computers](http:\/\/www.crn.com.au\/News\/81629,netbook-sales-to-soar-in-2008.aspx) like the Asus Eee PC, it leaves us to wonder where the big bucks might be coming from in the near future. Perhaps with this in mind, AMD downclocked and undervolted its Athlon64 segment to start headbutting with Intel\u2019s Atom architecture. Truth to be told, they apparently succeeded on creating a platform that outperforms Atom on efficiency, where as by efficiency we understand processing capacity over power consumed.

It is true that the Core 2 platform has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pcadvisor.co.uk\/news\/index.cfm?newsid=12061\" target=\"_blank\">smashed<\/a> the competition from AMD on pretty much every front of the market, but this tide might be about to turn.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the recent <a href=\"http:\/\/www.crn.com.au\/News\/81629,netbook-sales-to-soar-in-2008.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">outbreak of netbook computers<\/a> like the Asus Eee PC, it leaves us to wonder where the big bucks might be coming from in the near future. Perhaps with this in mind, AMD downclocked and undervolted its Athlon64 segment to start headbutting with Intel&#8217;s Atom architecture. Truth to be told, they apparently succeeded on creating a platform that outperforms Atom on efficiency, where as by efficiency we understand processing capacity over power consumed.

Firefox barely supports transparency, whereas Chrome allows for transparency, even on the zone where the tabs reside.\n\nIn a nutshell, it\u2019s still a beta version, and that does show.

My goal is to outline what I have learned from it and how much of a great experience that it was.\n\nFirst off, I was the very first MSP to arrive there, so I checked myself in and waited around for more people to come. Finally more and more people started coming and another MSP came, V\u00e2nia. \u201cOkay\u2026 what to do now? Let\u2019s get coffee.\u201d . After messing around with the map, we finally figured out where the *foyer* was and where we were meant to eat cookies(!) and get our morning coffee.\n\nAfter waiting for a while longer, more and more Student Partners started showing up and eventually the speeches started. The first one, with Pedro Rosa, was as usually quite good and before we knew it, we were having coffee again on the morning Coffee Break. Then off to speeches again, this time with Nuno Godinho; a speech on creating rich applications with Silverlight. Besides the fact that Nuno lost the notion of time on both of his speeches, they were quite helpful and inspiring. I had been wanting to try Silverlight for a while now and this was just the spark to get it going. Then came the speech about Visual Studio, which (I\u2019m sorry but) it was the less attractive one, even if I work with Visual Studio on almost a daily basis.\n\nAnd then it was time to lunch. They served some \u201cweird\u201d thing with codfish and \u2026 stuff BUT, the desserts were delicious so all in all, despite having to stand during the whole thing, it wasn\u2019t so bad.\n\nStuffed up and cosy and the moment of the day arrived: Steve Ballmer\u2019s keynote speech. Massive crowd waiting at the doors of the main auditorium and when we were finally allowed in, it looked like they were offering free candy on the inside! Everyone wanted in, and lucky me, I got a place right on the second row \ud83d\ude00 (yeah, the original plan was to catch a drop of Steve\u2019s saliva and sell it on eBay afterwards , but that just didn\u2019t happen\u2026 \ud83d\ude41 bummer!). Turns out that the first speaker wasn\u2019t really Steve Ballmer but Miguel Caldas, who was also going to give a keynote speech but on Internet Explorer 8.\n\n*sigh*\n\nDon\u2019t take me wrong, Miguel was, to say the least, captivating, enthusiastic and funny: the perfect mixture in a speaker, so despite us all being fooled into thinking that we were going to be hearing from Steve first, it was quite good to hear all about IE8. As Miguel said: on IE8, Microsoft is finally caring about standards and about developers. We all know how much of a pain in the rear it is to develop something that looks the same in Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera and Safari (\u2026and some other browsers out there \ud83d\ude1b like Miguel said \u2013 clearly talking about Chrome).\n\nAfter a while into Miguel\u2019s speech, Steve arrives on the building and he\u2019s announced with a quite funky music. This was **THE** moment of the day and I was enjoying it to the fullest! Steve delivered a fun and objective speech, and I found out how powerful his voice really is \ud83d\ude1b I bet he wouldn\u2019t really need a microphone nor speakers to get his voice to reach to the people back in the last rows. He does talk loud but also very clearly and without much of an accent.\n\nSo, about this speech, Steve basically pointed out where we are today and how things are developping at Microsoft, and how things are most likely to look in 10 years from now. He was also suspicious about someone being there to evaluate his IQ, as he kept tripping on one of the LCDs laid in front of him, on the ground \ud83d\ude1b so he said he \u201csuspected that someone was judging his ability to learn\u201d \u2013 you failed Steve. \ud83d\ude1b\n\nSo to cut this post short, afterwards we had the second part about Silverlight, then another coffee break and lastly, Pedro Rosa again, this time talking about Virtual Earth and how it can be used as a base to develop so many interesting and useful things. Definitely something to be looked upon. I still have to know more about the licensing because depending on that, I may be going to use it on a secret ASP .NET project of mine \ud83d\ude09 .\n\nIn a nutshell: the event was brilliantly organized (some chairs on the *foyer* and on the lunch-tent wouldn\u2019t have hurted though\u2026), I got in for free thanks to being a Microsoft Student Partner so\u2026 free education, free food and a free good time with friends\u2026 hell yes! I\u2019m all for that! \ud83d\ude00\n\nOh and Steve, thanks for your e-mail address.

Well, the out of the box answer for me is Firefox but let\u2019s have a deeper look at the contest shall we?\n\nWhat plays in favour of Google Chrome?  \n I for one really enjoyed the looks. It has a clean and sleek interface without your regular toolbar menus and without a caption bar. I find this amazing. It\u2019s the first browser that was designed with true usability in mind regarding the menu paraphernalia. The guys at Google really are being serious about seeing websites as actual applications, and proof of that is the fact that you can create \u201capplication links\u201d. This also plays in Chrome\u2019s favour in my opinion. There are pages that I simply have open at all times and ones that I have to be able to access quickly; Google Chrome with this feature allows me to run GMail (or any other website) as a separate window, simply by leaving an icon on my desktop. This separate window is also special, it has kind of usability on steroids since it has no menu whatsoever. It does have a caption, which in this case is good because I might want to move the window around while not maximized.\n\nOk, now that we\u2019re done talking about the user interface, we go on to the actual features. For starters, let\u2019s face it: [Google Chrome is **fast**](http:\/\/blogs.zdnet.com\/hardware\/?p=2507). Actually, it feels faster than Firefox as far as browsing is concerned. How do they achieve it? I\u2019m not exactly sure and if my suspicions are right, you can probably achieve the same effect with [FasterFox](http:\/\/fasterfox.mozdev.org\/) or with a [properly configured](http:\/\/www.ghacks.net\/2007\/03\/29\/10-tips-to-speed-up-opera-9\/trackback\/) Opera, but I\u2019m dealing with the facts here and that is that Chrome feels fast.\n\nThere is also a technical choice in Chrome that pleased me greatly, in part I\u2019m amazed that such a big open-source project like Mozilla Firefox, packed with paranoid security people let something like this go through on Firefox. The choice I\u2019m talking about is the fact that Chrome spawns different processes for each tab whereas Firefox uses a threading system instead. It is common programming knowledge that when it comes to security, processes are by far much safer than threads, not to mention the advantages regarding memory management. Why, you ask? Memory leaks. This isn\u2019t just some buzz word that came with Firefox, this is an actual problem that Firefox and many more applications suffer from. What is a memory leak? Again, to put it simply, it\u2019s memory of your system that was reserved but that wasn\u2019t marked as free when it was no longer needed. So if a browser eats 100Mb of your RAM, and when you, say, close a tab it does not free the resources that belonged to that tab, then the more tabs you open, the more memory the browser will be using, and it can only use ever so much. How does multiprocessing help prevent this? It\u2019s simple: since each tab runs in its own process, when the process dies (i.e. the tab is closed), the memory that was assigned to it gets released *automagically. *So even as far as plugins are concerned (to name a few: Flash, Silverligh, Acrobat Reader\u2026the list goes on), even if those are leaking memory, which has happened in the past, it will all be contained as soon as the tab is closed.\n\nIn practical terms, you open up Firefox and note down how much memory its using. Then browse for 6 hours in a row without closing and reopening the browser. Still, you open tabs, browse in those tabs, close some tabs, open up new ones and do some browsing following this procedure. Also, do visit some Flash-powered websites, and do view some PDF documents in-browser. In the end, close all the tabs but one, it can even be a blank, newly opened, tab. Now open your Task Manager and check how much memory Firefox is using. Note it down and do the same with Google Chrome. See what I\u2019m talking about? I\u2019m no future teller but Firefox will be using much memory after the 6 hours than it was in the beginning, and that is memory leaks plus memory fragmentation kicking in (which is also tameable by using processes instead of threads).\n\nSomething else that I find great about Chrome is its OmniBar. I had loved Firefox\u2019s Awesome Bar but OmniBar throws us to a completely different level of browsing. For instance it cuts off the need for two input boxes like Firefox has, since this address bar can do both automatic searching and regular browsing. Way to go Google. As of yet, I\u2019m still trying to find a Firefox plugin that perfectly mimics OmniBar\u2019s behaviour.\n\nThe incognito mode is also a neat little feature, specially when you are on public computers (or visiting sites that you should not be visiting\u2026..). This is something that has also been included on [Internet Explorer 8](http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windows\/internet-explorer\/beta\/default.aspx) (InPrivate) but apparently is [yet to be announced](http:\/\/www.zdnetasia.com\/news\/security\/0,39044215,62042653,00.htm) on Firefox, even if I\u2019m pretty sure that there\u2019s already some addon out there that serves the same purpose.\n\nLastly there\u2019s the download management. Chrome\u2019s way of handling downloads is far from perfect, but I still like it better than that of Firefox. I really dislike having a separate window in my task pane just for downloads. It\u2019s a real pain in the rear when you\u2019re using the feature on Windows that allows you to group windows of the same application. I think there is still some work needed on this.\n\nNow, for the not-so-good things about Chrome.  \n The spell checker. For God\u2019s sake, I still cannot believe that you cannot change the spell checker language without having to restart the whole browser! And even more, you have to crawl through the menus to achieve that. Thank you Firefox for allowing me to do that on the context menu.\n\nThe lack of extendibility. Unfortunately, Google Chrome still does not support plugins or addons, nor does it support themes. A shame really, specially because it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s something that it\u2019s being worked upon, since their policy seems to be simplicity. This is kind of both good and bad.\n\nIt\u2019s still **very** beta. There\u2019s features missing (print selected text anyone?), it\u2019s still kinda buggy and well, it still needs a lot of work. As an advantage is the fact that it\u2019s an open-source project, meaning that if there are bugs, there\u2019s a high likeliness that the community will find and report them, and when those bugs are security-critical, this is a massive advantage over closed-source projects.\n\nI also feel that Chrome\u2019s password management is less intuitive and neat than Firefox\u2019s. Maybe I\u2019ve just grown used to the way Firefox handles things. I don\u2019t really know.\n\nI believe I have in one way or another, covered out everything on both browsers, at least the things that affect me directly. There is a specific addon for Firefox that I cannot go without, that is [Foxmarks](http:\/\/www.foxmarks.com\/). This addon allows me to share bookmarks across several computers, and I simply cannot get anything like it on Google Chrome, which is sad really. I keep a toolbar with my neatly organized bookmarks and if they aren\u2019t coherent across all my computers, then it defeats the purpose of having it there.\n\nThere\u2019s another topic on the \u00abbrowser-war\u00bb that I would like to address here: memory usage. No, I\u2019m not going to show screenshots or make videos of how Firefox uses less or more memory than Chrome, or anything like it. For ages, we\u2019ve been living on the edge of a good program translating into a program that uses little memory. Nowadays this is a **VERY** wrong concept. In the early days, the RAM memory available was scarce and sometimes we had to make the craziest juggles to even play certain games. Today, we typically have more RAM memory than we can handle; memory which just sits there on our computer, idling. Now, think for a minute: what good is it to have free memory? Yeah, sure it prevents the computer for using the swap file since there\u2019s always free memory for that one application you\u2019ve just started but hold on for a second. The RAM is extremely fast when compared to your hard drive, so populating the RAM with data that might be handy in the near future is a measure that will for sure make your computer feel faster. If resources for a certain application are being loaded from the RAM rather than from the hard-drive, you will notice that the application runs faster.\n\nSo I think you see where I am getting here? I don\u2019t really mind if browser X uses more RAM when compared to browser Y, as long as that RAM is being put to good use. That is, as long as that memory is being used to make the application run faster.\n\nFirefox actually has a go at this but the Mozilla guys kind of failed. Firefox does use a ton of memory but it\u2019s far from being used to enhance speed, it\u2019s basically memory that gets left over and forgotten about. Since Firefox runs in one single process, this also builds up memory fragmentation within the process, which just adds up to the RAM being wasted mindlessly. The idea of fragmentation is as follows: say that you have 3 tabs. The first is using 20Mb of your RAM, the second is using 5Mb and the third is using 15Mb and also assume that they were opened by this order, thus they are ordered like that in the process\u2019 memory space (it\u2019s much more complex than this, but for this purpose we can simplify it like that). Then you decide that the second tab (the one with 5Mb) is no longer needed and you close it. Tada, you just have created a hole in your memory. Firefox **won\u2019t** reorganize the memory assignments just to fill the gap with the existing tabs, set aside the operating system doing that.\n\nNow there are two scenarios:  \n \u2013 You open a tab that by default uses up 10Mb and therefore it won\u2019t fit the gap. (You are wasting the 5Mb that despite being free, they can\u2019t be used by whatever else that requires more space)  \n \u2013 You open a tab that starts up at 2Mb, and as you browse on it, it grows to 15Mb. Then you\u2019ll have fragmentation. Part of your tab\u2019s data will be on that gap, and the rest will be somewhere else.\n\nEither scenario is undesirable and also avoidable with processes instead of tabs.\n\nBut hey, I\u2019m going to stop hitting the same key, it\u2019s just that apparently Mozilla has pushed this notion way down on their priority stack and this is just foolish.

However, Mozilla is working on a completely new Javascript engine, TraceMonkey, which [at first sight](http:\/\/andreasgal.com\/2008\/09\/03\/tracemonkey-vs-v8\/) will put a hell of a fight with Chrome\u2019s V8. Who benefits from this? Us, users, of course. The more they fight, the better served we are \ud83d\ude09 .\n\nTo finish off my post, I just would like to clarify the reason I stick with Firefox. The point is that Firefox has been out there for quite a while now, and despite its security flaws here and there that have happened throghout time, it is pretty rock solid and secure. Google Chrome still has a lot to prove, it\u2019s still embrionary and it has a lot of growing up to do. Firefox also allows me to use addons that allow me to extend its features and I value this deeply, specially the possibility of using Foxmarks and of changing dictionaries quickly. These are practical things that I cannot go without, hence choosing Firefox for my day-to-day tasks. However, if what you do isn\u2019t exactly mission critical and if there aren\u2019t any extensions for Firefox that you use, then by all means, stick with Google Chrome. Only with a good userbase a piece of software can be improved.\n\n\n","html":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, really, now that the hype is over, what is the browser of choice? Well, the out of the box answer for me is Firefox but let&#8217;s have a deeper look at the contest shall we?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What plays in favour of Google Chrome?<br \/>\nI for one really enjoyed the looks. It has a clean and sleek interface without your regular toolbar menus and without a caption bar. I find this amazing. It&#8217;s the first browser that was designed with true usability in mind regarding the menu paraphernalia. The guys at Google really are being serious about seeing websites as actual applications, and proof of that is the fact that you can create &#8220;application links&#8221;. This also plays in Chrome&#8217;s favour in my opinion. There are pages that I simply have open at all times and ones that I have to be able to access quickly; Google Chrome with this feature allows me to run GMail (or any other website) as a separate window, simply by leaving an icon on my desktop. This separate window is also special, it has kind of usability on steroids since it has no menu whatsoever. It does have a caption, which in this case is good because I might want to move the window around while not maximized.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ok, now that we&#8217;re done talking about the user interface, we go on to the actual features. For starters, let&#8217;s face it: <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.zdnet.com\/hardware\/?p=2507\" target=\"_blank\">Google Chrome is <strong>fast<\/strong><\/a>. Actually, it feels faster than Firefox as far as browsing is concerned. How do they achieve it? I&#8217;m not exactly sure and if my suspicions are right, you can probably achieve the same effect with <a href=\"http:\/\/fasterfox.mozdev.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">FasterFox<\/a> or with a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ghacks.net\/2007\/03\/29\/10-tips-to-speed-up-opera-9\/trackback\/\" target=\"_blank\">properly configured<\/a> Opera, but I&#8217;m dealing with the facts here and that is that Chrome feels fast.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is also a technical choice in Chrome that pleased me greatly, in part I&#8217;m amazed that such a big open-source project like Mozilla Firefox, packed with paranoid security people let something like this go through on Firefox. The choice I&#8217;m talking about is the fact that Chrome spawns different processes for each tab whereas Firefox uses a threading system instead. It is common programming knowledge that when it comes to security, processes are by far much safer than threads, not to mention the advantages regarding memory management. Why, you ask? Memory leaks. This isn&#8217;t just some buzz word that came with Firefox, this is an actual problem that Firefox and many more applications suffer from. What is a memory leak? Again, to put it simply, it&#8217;s memory of your system that was reserved but that wasn&#8217;t marked as free when it was no longer needed. So if a browser eats 100Mb of your RAM, and when you, say, close a tab it does not free the resources that belonged to that tab, then the more tabs you open, the more memory the browser will be using, and it can only use ever so much. How does multiprocessing help prevent this? It&#8217;s simple: since each tab runs in its own process, when the process dies (i.e. the tab is closed), the memory that was assigned to it gets released <em>automagically. <\/em>So even as far as plugins are concerned (to name a few: Flash, Silverligh, Acrobat Reader&#8230;the list goes on), even if those are leaking memory, which has happened in the past, it will all be contained as soon as the tab is closed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In practical terms, you open up Firefox and note down how much memory its using. Then browse for 6 hours in a row without closing and reopening the browser. Still, you open tabs, browse in those tabs, close some tabs, open up new ones and do some browsing following this procedure. Also, do visit some Flash-powered websites, and do view some PDF documents in-browser. In the end, close all the tabs but one, it can even be a blank, newly opened, tab. Now open your Task Manager and check how much memory Firefox is using. Note it down and do the same with Google Chrome. See what I&#8217;m talking about? I&#8217;m no future teller but Firefox will be using much memory after the 6 hours than it was in the beginning, and that is memory leaks plus memory fragmentation kicking in (which is also tameable by using processes instead of threads).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Something else that I find great about Chrome is its OmniBar. I had loved Firefox&#8217;s Awesome Bar but OmniBar throws us to a completely different level of browsing. For instance it cuts off the need for two input boxes like Firefox has, since this address bar can do both automatic searching and regular browsing. Way to go Google. As of yet, I&#8217;m still trying to find a Firefox plugin that perfectly mimics OmniBar&#8217;s behaviour.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The incognito mode is also a neat little feature, specially when you are on public computers (or visiting sites that you should not be visiting&#8230;..). This is something that has also been included on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windows\/internet-explorer\/beta\/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Internet Explorer 8<\/a> (InPrivate) but apparently is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zdnetasia.com\/news\/security\/0,39044215,62042653,00.htm\" target=\"_blank\">yet to be announced<\/a> on Firefox, even if I&#8217;m pretty sure that there&#8217;s already some addon out there that serves the same purpose.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lastly there&#8217;s the download management. Chrome&#8217;s way of handling downloads is far from perfect, but I still like it better than that of Firefox. I really dislike having a separate window in my task pane just for downloads. It&#8217;s a real pain in the rear when you&#8217;re using the feature on Windows that allows you to group windows of the same application. I think there is still some work needed on this.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, for the not-so-good things about Chrome.<br \/>\nThe spell checker. For God&#8217;s sake, I still cannot believe that you cannot change the spell checker language without having to restart the whole browser! And even more, you have to crawl through the menus to achieve that. Thank you Firefox for allowing me to do that on the context menu.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lack of extendibility. Unfortunately, Google Chrome still does not support plugins or addons, nor does it support themes. A shame really, specially because it doesn&#8217;t seem like it&#8217;s something that it&#8217;s being worked upon, since their policy seems to be simplicity. This is kind of both good and bad.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&#8217;s still <strong>very<\/strong> beta. There&#8217;s features missing (print selected text anyone?), it&#8217;s still kinda buggy and well, it still needs a lot of work. As an advantage is the fact that it&#8217;s an open-source project, meaning that if there are bugs, there&#8217;s a high likeliness that the community will find and report them, and when those bugs are security-critical, this is a massive advantage over closed-source projects.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I also feel that Chrome&#8217;s password management is less intuitive and neat than Firefox&#8217;s. Maybe I&#8217;ve just grown used to the way Firefox handles things. I don&#8217;t really know.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I believe I have in one way or another, covered out everything on both browsers, at least the things that affect me directly. There is a specific addon for Firefox that I cannot go without, that is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foxmarks.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Foxmarks<\/a>. This addon allows me to share bookmarks across several computers, and I simply cannot get anything like it on Google Chrome, which is sad really. I keep a toolbar with my neatly organized bookmarks and if they aren&#8217;t coherent across all my computers, then it defeats the purpose of having it there.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There&#8217;s another topic on the \u00abbrowser-war\u00bb that I would like to address here: memory usage. No, I&#8217;m not going to show screenshots or make videos of how Firefox uses less or more memory than Chrome, or anything like it. For ages, we&#8217;ve been living on the edge of a good program translating into a program that uses little memory. Nowadays this is a <strong>VERY<\/strong> wrong concept. In the early days, the RAM memory available was scarce and sometimes we had to make the craziest juggles to even play certain games. Today, we typically have more RAM memory than we can handle; memory which just sits there on our computer, idling. Now, think for a minute: what good is it to have free memory? Yeah, sure it prevents the computer for using the swap file since there&#8217;s always free memory for that one application you&#8217;ve just started but hold on for a second. The RAM is extremely fast when compared to your hard drive, so populating the RAM with data that might be handy in the near future is a measure that will for sure make your computer feel faster. If resources for a certain application are being loaded from the RAM rather than from the hard-drive, you will notice that the application runs faster.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So I think you see where I am getting here? I don&#8217;t really mind if browser X uses more RAM when compared to browser Y, as long as that RAM is being put to good use. That is, as long as that memory is being used to make the application run faster.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Firefox actually has a go at this but the Mozilla guys kind of failed. Firefox does use a ton of memory but it&#8217;s far from being used to enhance speed, it&#8217;s basically memory that gets left over and forgotten about. Since Firefox runs in one single process, this also builds up memory fragmentation within the process, which just adds up to the RAM being wasted mindlessly. The idea of fragmentation is as follows: say that you have 3 tabs. The first is using 20Mb of your RAM, the second is using 5Mb and the third is using 15Mb and also assume that they were opened by this order, thus they are ordered like that in the process&#8217; memory space (it&#8217;s much more complex than this, but for this purpose we can simplify it like that). Then you decide that the second tab (the one with 5Mb) is no longer needed and you close it. Tada, you just have created a hole in your memory. Firefox <strong>won&#8217;t<\/strong> reorganize the memory assignments just to fill the gap with the existing tabs, set aside the operating system doing that.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now there are two scenarios:<br \/>\n&#8211; You open a tab that by default uses up 10Mb and therefore it won&#8217;t fit the gap. (You are wasting the 5Mb that despite being free, they can&#8217;t be used by whatever else that requires more space)<br \/>\n&#8211; You open a tab that starts up at 2Mb, and as you browse on it, it grows to 15Mb. Then you&#8217;ll have fragmentation. Part of your tab&#8217;s data will be on that gap, and the rest will be somewhere else.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Either scenario is undesirable and also avoidable with processes instead of tabs.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But hey, I&#8217;m going to stop hitting the same key, it&#8217;s just that apparently Mozilla has pushed this notion way down on their priority stack and this is just foolish. I&#8217;m sure it will take a lot of work to switch from threads to processes, but it will be really worth it in the end.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The last remark on the two browsers<br \/>\nThere&#8217;s a new fight going on right now which is the Javascript fight.

Optimization, right? This is truer on a special case and I am refering to the operating systems. Windows, Mac OS, Linux-based\u2026 you know the drill.\n\nOptimization is by nature, a very herculean task, especially when you are developing a piece of software to run on a wide variety of platforms and environments. Sure, some of the most recent computers come with dual-core CPUs, but pretty much all operating systems **must** still be able to operate on single-core processors, just as they have to be able to handle 4 or 8 cores effectively. This is not only true in the case of processors but also on RAM. If an operating system is running on 256Mb of RAM, it must certainly behave differently resource-wise than it will behave on a system with 4Gb of available RAM. More to the point, what is the use of having 4Gb of RAM, if 3Gb stay unused at all times? One could argue that having available memory is good because it allows the applications to use more as they need it, without resorting to swap files, but for the most part it is wasted memory, a precious resource in our computers.\n\nWith this said, for companies like Microsoft, it certainly is hard to develop an operating system that will efficiently handle old and new, resource-limited and resource-boasted platforms, simply because they create Windows for a variety of hardware. Windows will run on AMD, Intel and VIA and although they all are x86-based, there are certain instructions, that could be used to optimize but are not, because if my Core 2 Duo has SSE4, my friend\u2019s Athlon XP 3000+ hasn\u2019t got this set of instructions and therefore an application optimized for my CPU won\u2019t actually run on his.\n\nThis is, to some extent, the story of Windows Vista. Windows Vista brought quite a few innovations when compared to XP but it had a problem: if your resources are on the lower end, your computer will feel like a sloth on a lazy day and XP feels like cool breeze when compared to Vista. However, if you have ever had the chance to try out Vista on a powerful system, you\u2019ll be in awe simply because it will feel as fast as XP and you have all the goodies. Windows 7 by the way, is set to change this, but let us keep that to a different post as that is off-subject.\n\nSo, what is the main characteristic of a Macintosh computer? Until very recently, they used hardware unlike that of PCs but not anymore, their hardware is now similar and compatible with PC hardware. Actually, its parts are normal PC parts, with Intel CPUs and Intel\/Nvidia\/ATI graphics cards so what is really different? It\u2019s simple: they come assembled and are not meant to be disassembled at the risk of getting your warranty voided.\n\nMy point is that if Apple keeps such a high-standard on their computers and keeps them so expensive, why not turn the competition knob a notch? Pack their computers with like 8Gb of RAM at least and with 1Tb hard drives. In a way, Apple has started optimizing since Mac OS 10.5 will only run on at least the Core 2 Duo platform and this is a good thing, but I still think that RAM is a major factor in computers that is being systematically (and wrongly) left behind. However, if you have 8Gb of RAM, you could almost reserve 4Gb just for pre-fetching most used applications **before** the user needs them, and still have plenty of RAM for the average user to mess with. Maybe we need to go big and supersize and make a break with the past of computing.\n\nWhat is the real problem? Not knowing in advance when and how much RAM the user will need. So if an operating system starts using all the available (free) memory to pre-fetch applications, if at some point the user needs an application that requires, say, 512Mb of RAM and that program wasn\u2019t pre-fetched, the OS will have to quickly ditch 512Mb of that pre-fetch RAM and quickly load that program into memory. The problem? This can\u2019t happen quickly because the program will be loaded from the hard drive and the hard drive is inherently slow.\n\nEffectively, the memory allocation algorithm has to have something like a behaviour analysis module. Something that records the user behaviour and finds patterns, and even then it has to give room for the unexpected.

Usenet started off in 1979 as a forum-like service. It was a discussion board were allowed to discuss and share opinions, very much like forums as we know them nowadays. Instead of using your webclient, you would have to use an e-mail client with support for NNTP (the newsgroups protocol) or an actual application dedicated to newsgroups, this means that this service, unlike forums, doesn\u2019t work over HTTP but over a different protocol, NNTP.\n\nWhat happened after was that people realized the potential of the newsgroup servers for other purposes, namely file distributing based on a centralized server (as opposed to peer-to-peer). Such newsgroup servers are most commonly provided over very powerful Internet backbones which makes them great platforms for distributing all kinds of binary files to several people just at the cost of one single upload.\n\nAnd so it started happening. Programs were developed that were able to post binary files on newsgroups, and newsgroup clients that were able to download binary files also started showing up. From posting innocent files to using Usenet as a gateway for piracy was quite a small leap and nowadays one could say that the Usenet is perhaps most used for illegal content than for actual discussion of ideas.\n\nNow, back to my application. HaxTools is a proof of concept set of tools; therefore, I won\u2019t be liable for any damage it causes to your computer or to **whatever** uses people give it. In principle, the program does not violate any terms of service, although it is likely that the service it uses currently (http:\/\/rafb.net\/paste\/) will get up measures to fight it.\n\nMy application makes use of PasteBin sites (like the RAFB.net) to store files online. The HaxUploader allows you to choose the granularity of the upload up to 500Kb (meaning that your file will be sliced in 500Kb pieces) and allows files of up to 10Mb \u2013 this limit is in place so that your computer doesn\u2019t crash. This is just because I had no concern with optimization, so all operations are done in memory, which can be cumbersome on the computer for big files. However, optimizations can indeed be made so that all operations are done out of the hard drive, making the process slower but workable for bigger files. Depending on the success of this proof of concept, I may get into optimizing the idea.\n\nHow does it work from a user\u2019s perspective?  \n Nothing simpler. The user chooses a file on HaxUploader, presses upload and waits until the green bar gets filled completely and links show up on the box below. When the links are there, you just have to copy the said links (**don\u2019t ever change the order!**) and distribute them to other people.\n\nFrom the receiver\u2019s perspective, they will open HaxDownloader, paste in the links on the **SAME** order as they have received them and press Download. After a while, a message will appear saying that the process was completed; at this point, on the same folder as HaxDownloader was ran, there will be a NewFile.bin \u2013 this is the standard name for all downloaded files. Afterwards you\u2019ll have to rename it to whatever you like and also keep in mind that you do have to change the extension of the file to what it was originally \u2013 this is also something that could be done better in an actual program.\n\nAfter that is done, your file is ready to use. Whether it is a RAR file, or an MP3\u2026 whatever, it will work with all file types and we\u2019ll now get to how it works from the code\u2019s perspective.\n\nWhat\u2019s the whole idea? In a nutshell, the HaxUploader grabs the file it is meant to upload, streams it into memory (treating it as a binary file, thus working for any kind of files) and then moves on to convert the file contents to Base64. This is the standard format on which files are stored on Usenet; so the core idea is kept. With the contents on Base64, it goes on to split them into smaller chunks (given by the granularity setting) and uploads each of the chunks into a separate \u2018pasting\u2019.\n\nWhen it has finally submitted all the parts and acquired all the links from the \u2018pastings\u2019 we\u2019re all done and it simply outputs the links to the user.\n\nThe order in which the links are arranged does matter and it is imperative that they are kept in the order they are provided to you, otherwise it simply won\u2019t work as I haven\u2019t put in place any order measure. (It can be done though and on an actual application this would be needed).\n\nThe Downloader program simply fetches the content of the paste links, puts it all back together and decodes the Base64 string into binary, recreating the file.\n\nAs a final note, there isn\u2019t a big deal of protections and validations in place, that is why this is a proof of concept \u2013 I just wanted to prove that it can be done.\n\nFor now I am not releasing the source code but just the binaries. If you are interested in the source code, you can contact me at tiago[at]espinhas[dot]net and we can discuss the situation.\n\nUntil the next time!\n\n\n","html":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here I am again with a crazy project of mine: HaxTools.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ok, the name wasn&#8217;t particularly well thought but I think you will find the idea quite well engineered.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On a little background note, let me introduce you to Usenet.

My graphics card (a humble PowerColor HD4850) was overheating to smithereens. Each time I wanted to play a game I would manually pump up the only small fan, increasing the noise tenfold, only to keep the temperature at a scorching 100\u00baC.\n\nYes, you read correctly. Under load (running Team Fortress 2) this card would easily reach the 100 degrees Celsius. The funny thing about it? It wouldn\u2019t absolutely stutter at all!\n\nAfter having done research on it, I came to the conclusion that this card was simply [hot by nature](http:\/\/www.overclock.net\/ati\/347689-hd4850-heat-problem-hot-do-i.html). Or, better put, the stock cooler is not appropriate for the kind of heat this graphics card generates. There is being hot and there is not having appropriate cooling. This case is most certainly the latter.\n\nMy results, despite not having screenshots of it, were of:  \n \u2013 80\u00baC idle (with the fan at 40% \u2013 which is the maximum I was willing to go noise-wise)  \n \u2013 100\u00baC ++ load (with the fan at 80% and a deafening noise that even got my mom scared about it)\n\nNow, while the card was most certainly designed with this sort of temperatures in mind, heat rarely does any good to electrical components. When we\u2019re talking about temperatures enough to make your kettle whistle, then you know you should do something about it.\n\nI did.\n\nToday, I bought the Accelero Twin Turbo and at first I was a little reluctant. I was afraid it was just going to be more of the same as the stock cooler, with little improvement. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. The installation is pretty straight-forward, although, to its own right, the RAM and voltage regulators heatsinks definitely could use more glue. With a little nudge I managed to remove one of the heatsinks so I am still wondering how they will hold up through time (literally).\n\nThis cooler packs quite a punch when compared to the stock cooler. It comes with two 80mm fans, attached to a massive aluminum block, which has a copper pipeline system that goes straight to the actual block that attaches to the GPU. Keep in mind that space may be an issue with this cooler; if you are going for CrossFire then think again about buying the Twin Turbo as your graphics card will use up THREE slots on the back of your computer case.\n\nIt is crazy, I know, but right now I have the same 40% setting on the fans (this cooler is pluggable to your graphics\u2019 card fan power supply) and I get a cool 33\u00baC . While gaming, it never goes above the 36\u00baC and that is with the very same 40% !\n\nAs far as noise goes, it can\u2019t even compare to the stock cooler, which is actually expectable. There is a trade-off between the size of a fan, the amount of air it can move per second and the noise in decibels it produces. Basically, with a bigger fan, you can move the same (or a bigger) amount of air with the same (or less) noise. These two fans are really silent, barely audible. If I push them to 100% then you actually start to hear them, but at 100% they are less audible than the single, stock fan, at 80%.\n\nSo if you still needed any proof that this is the cooler for you, look no further. This will solve ALL your temperature problems and I advocate that this graphics card should actually come with one of these coolers by default.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Recently I had been having a problem. My graphics card (a humble PowerColor HD4850) was overheating to smithereens. Each time I wanted to play a game I would manually pump up the only small fan, increasing the noise tenfold, only to keep the temperature at a scorching 100\u00baC.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, you read correctly. Under load (running Team Fortress 2) this card would easily reach the 100 degrees Celsius. The funny thing about it? It wouldn&#8217;t absolutely stutter at all!<\/p>\n<p>After having done research on it, I came to the conclusion that this card was simply <a href=\"http:\/\/www.overclock.net\/ati\/347689-hd4850-heat-problem-hot-do-i.html\" target=\"_blank\">hot by nature<\/a>. Or, better put, the stock cooler is not appropriate for the kind of heat this graphics card generates. There is being hot and there is not having appropriate cooling. This case is most certainly the latter.<\/p>\n<p>My results, despite not having screenshots of it, were of:<br \/>\n&#8211; 80\u00baC idle (with the fan at 40% &#8211; which is the maximum I was willing to go noise-wise)<br \/>\n&#8211; 100\u00baC ++ load (with the fan at 80% and a deafening noise that even got my mom scared about it)<\/p>\n<p>Now, while the card was most certainly designed with this sort of temperatures in mind, heat rarely does any good to electrical components. When we&#8217;re talking about temperatures enough to make your kettle whistle, then you know you should do something about it.<\/p>\n<p>I did.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I bought the Accelero Twin Turbo and at first I was a little reluctant. I was afraid it was just going to be more of the same as the stock cooler, with little improvement. I couldn&#8217;t have been more wrong. The installation is pretty straight-forward, although, to its own right, the RAM and voltage regulators heatsinks definitely could use more glue. With a little nudge I managed to remove one of the heatsinks so I am still wondering how they will hold up through time (literally).<\/p>\n<p>This cooler packs quite a punch when compared to the stock cooler. It comes with two 80mm fans, attached to a massive aluminum block, which has a copper pipeline system that goes straight to the actual block that attaches to the GPU. Keep in mind that space may be an issue with this cooler; if you are going for CrossFire then think again about buying the Twin Turbo as your graphics card will use up THREE slots on the back of your computer case.<\/p>\n<p>It is crazy, I know, but right now I have the same 40% setting on the fans (this cooler is pluggable to your graphics&#8217; card fan power supply) and I get a cool 33\u00baC . While gaming, it never goes above the 36\u00baC and that is with the very same 40% !<\/p>\n<p>As far as noise goes, it can&#8217;t even compare to the stock cooler, which is actually expectable. There is a trade-off between the size of a fan, the amount of air it can move per second and the noise in decibels it produces. Basically, with a bigger fan, you can move the same (or a bigger) amount of air with the same (or less) noise. These two fans are really silent, barely audible. If I push them to 100% then you actually start to hear them, but at 100% they are less audible than the single, stock fan, at 80%.<\/p>\n<p>So if you still needed any proof that this is the cooler for you, look no further. This will solve ALL your temperature problems and I advocate that this graphics card should actually come with one of these coolers by default.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Fri, 06 Mar 2009 21:40:01 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 06 Mar 2009 21:40:39 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 06 Mar 2009 21:40:01 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":162,"title":"What's hot?","slug":"whats-hot","markdown":"\nI am certainly not.

Okay, it doesn\u2019t directly harm your health or anything like it, but what about psychologically? What do you think of doing when you have free time? Do you ever think about working on your own projects? Do you even have **any** own projects? Probably not, because WoW is so much more tempting\u2026 no wonder.\n\n3. No, people really don\u2019t want to hear about your Sword of 1000 Truths, yet when you spend long enough time on the game this will seemingly be the only topic you know how to talk about.

This comes enabled by default on XP and Vista and it was not addressed in Windows 7. Basically, as [Adrian over at ZDNet](http:\/\/blogs.zdnet.com\/hardware\/?p=4317&tag=nl.e550) reports, with this feature enabled, a file with \u2018double extension\u2019 can easily be fooled for its fake extention.

This is a feature that I disable right after I install Windows. More often than not I find myself having to change the extension of a file, and it\u2019s impossible to do so with this feature enabled and without resorting to the command line.\n\nThis feature is dangerous and it has been the gateway for many viruses to spread.

This is totally feasible since my grade average, last I checked, was of 14 marks in a 20-point scale, which rounds to roughly 70% in a loose conversion.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cool, hey? \ud83d\ude00 Now let&#8217;s just hope those money leechs at the bank will loan me the money I need!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just on a little background, I&#8217;ll be taking the Advanced Software Engineering (MSc) course at the University of Leicester, with a start date of September 28th 2009.

As of a couple of months ago, I received a letter saying I had been accepted. The said letter was a conditional offer from the University, where the condition was obtaining my current degree (BSc in Computer Science) with an average grade no lower than 65%.\n\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d \u2013 I thought. 65% in a 20 point scale represents 13 points, which would be totally doable with my 14.2 points average.\n\nStill, just to be sure, I decided to e-mail the Post-Graduate Admissions Office to assert how much would 65% be in my scale. For much of my surprise, I am told that 65% actually corresponds to 16 marks in my grading system. I was shocked. This meant that my goal simply could not be done\u2026\n\nI e-mailed the PGA office back, asking whether that hadn\u2019t in fact been a mistake. Some days passed. Since the last time I e-mailed the PGA office it took them some two weeks to come back at me, I thought I\u2019d send in the artillery and decided to call them. The lady who picked up my call didn\u2019t know how to help me but checked with a colleague who told her that I would have to contact the UK NARIC if I wasn\u2019t happy with that grade comparison.\n\nSo I did. I e-mailed UK NARIC, only to realize that this is actually a paid service in the UK that provides people with comparison statements between systems in foreign countries and the UK system. Without being very helpful, their reply mentioned a \u00a340 fee for requesting such a statement, without a warranty at all that I would get in at Leicester in the end.\n\nIn the same day (yesterday), I also decided to e-mail my course coordinator (Prof. Patr\u00edcio Domingues) at ESTG; I thought that perhaps he could help me and he did in fact help me. He provided me with a link to the Portuguese Republic Diary (Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica) where it clearly states that the grade range of 60% through 69% in the UK corresponds to 16 marks in Portugal. Bummer. It was all going down the drain\u2026 but I wasn\u2019t just about to give up.

She\u2019d been the one to announce that I had been accepted so I thought that she could help me in this situation. In my second e-mail, since the artillery had failed before \u2013 I had to send a nuke. And so I did. I factored it all in. I mentioned the fact that on the entry requirements it says that the applicant should have a good Second Class degree, and that Second Class is actually divided in the First and Second division (60 to 69% and 50 to 59% respectively). So technically I do have a Second Class degree with my 14 marks.

While there is some truth to their claims, they are also being unnecessarily alarmist and making false claims.\n\nThe specifics of this exploit is that when you hacktivate an iPhone (i.e. activate it using Jailbreak), your iPhone will be using a private\/public key pair to register with Apple\u2019s PNS (Push Notification Service) that already exists, in other words, it will be using a key that was not generated to your iPhone but that will be common to everyone who hacktivates their iPhone.\n\nAs a result, when a notification comes addressed to that key, all of the iPhones in the world that have been hacktivated would in theory receive that message.\n\nStill, at AppleInsider they claim:\n\n> Destroying the application security layer of the iPhone does not itself automatically break PNS, but (**when combined with an \u201cunofficial activation\u201d required to use it with unofficial service providers**) results in the system having no legitimate certificates to use in performing push notifications. Essentially, if the phone is not properly activated as intended through iTunes, the user\u2019s credentials for signing into Apple\u2019s PNS messaging servers (which are generated by the device itself in normal conditions) are broken along with the application security layer.\n\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, little Timmy! Let\u2019s debunk this, shall we?\n\n1. An unofficial activation (read, hacktivation) is\u00a0**NOT** required to use it with unofficial service providers. If an iPhone is already officially activated, the jailbreak will not reactivate it.\n2. Jailbreaking does\u00a0**NOT** necessarily mean that you want to use your iPhone with unofficial service providers. Jailbreaking simply allows you to install third-party applications, such that aren\u2019t installed through the regular AppStore.\n3. You need to jailbreak to use the iPhone with an unofficial service provider, but jailbreaking does not have only that purpose. You can for instance jailbreak to run cracked games. Sure, it doesn\u2019t make it any more legitimate or legal, but it is not the same thing.\n\nFinally, I must stress the notion: if you have an officially activated iPhone and if you jailbroke it afterwards, YOU ARE SAFE. Actually, I am not sure about the status of redsn0w right now, but when it was first released the push notifications would not even work for hacktivated iPhones! Still, if you would activate your iPhone normally and then jailbreak it, you would get your push notifications working. In a nutshell, if you have it officially activated, jailbreak will not put you at risk of being spammed.\n\nAs for hacktivated iPhones\u2026 well, tough luck guys. It seems like you are better off turning of the push notifications if you don\u2019t want to be spammed in a near future.\n\n[via [Engadget](http:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2009\/07\/23\/iphone-3-0s-broken-push-messaging-caused-by-unlockers-dirty\/)]\n\n\n","html":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">good<\/span> silly folks over at AppleInsider are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.appleinsider.com\/articles\/09\/07\/22\/hackers_break_iphone_push_messaging_blame_apple.html\" target=\"_blank\">reporting<\/a> on a flaw that might open the iPhone OS 3.0 to mass spam.

Let&#8217;s debunk this, shall we?<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>An unofficial activation (read, hacktivation) is\u00a0<strong>NOT<\/strong> required to use it with unofficial service providers. If an iPhone is already officially activated, the jailbreak will not reactivate it.<\/li>\n<li>Jailbreaking does\u00a0<strong>NOT<\/strong> necessarily mean that you want to use your iPhone with unofficial service providers. Jailbreaking simply allows you to install third-party applications, such that aren&#8217;t installed through the regular AppStore.<\/li>\n<li>You need to jailbreak to use the iPhone with an unofficial service provider, but jailbreaking does not have only that purpose. You can for instance jailbreak to run cracked games. Sure, it doesn&#8217;t make it any more legitimate or legal, but it is not the same thing.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, I must stress the notion: if you have an officially activated iPhone and if you jailbroke it afterwards, YOU ARE SAFE. Actually, I am not sure about the status of redsn0w right now, but when it was first released the push notifications would not even work for hacktivated iPhones! Still, if you would activate your iPhone normally and then jailbreak it, you would get your push notifications working. In a nutshell, if you have it officially activated, jailbreak will not put you at risk of being spammed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for hacktivated iPhones&#8230; well, tough luck guys. It seems like you are better off turning of the push notifications if you don&#8217;t want to be spammed in a near future.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2009\/07\/23\/iphone-3-0s-broken-push-messaging-caused-by-unlockers-dirty\/\" target=\"_blank\">Engadget<\/a>]<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Thu, 23 Jul 2009 13:11:34 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Thu, 23 Jul 2009 13:14:43 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Thu, 23 Jul 2009 13:11:34 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":153,"title":"Samsung Omnia versus Nokia \"iPhone-killer\" 5800 XpressMusic versus iPhone 3G","slug":"temp-slug-66","markdown":"\nToday I bring you a head-to-head comparison of two smartphones. As the title says, I will be comparing some of the features on both phones and in the end I will make a verdict.\n\nI have not only used both phones for testing purposes; actually, initially I bought the Samsung Omnia 8Gb with the intention of keeping it. My thoughts were that it came with Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional (it played as a plus in my decision when I bought it), it had a stunning 5.1 megapixel camera and from all the reviews I had read, the phone felt really sturdy and very well built. I could not agree more. The phone feels a little \u201cbricky\u201d in one\u2019s hand, but that is because it is so thin and its bezel on the back is a little too \u201csquarey\u201d.\n\nStill, I went ahead and bought this phone. First annoyance: the memory cards are not hotswappable. You have to remove the battery to access the memory card slot; same goes for the SIM card but that is pretty much the standard.\n\nOnce you turn on the Omnia for the first time, you will notice a small tab on the lower-left corner. This tab lets you access the widget sidebar. Yes, with this phone you get cute (and useless) gadgets that you can drag onto your tiny little \u201cdesktop\u201d (if you could call it that).  \n The good: It looks really cool and you can brag to your mates about your phone having draggable widgets.  \n The bad: Pretty much all the widgets are useless as a wrench is to tighten a screw.  \n The ugly: Seriously Samsung? Not even a single widget that allows you to lock and unlock the phone, like the iPhone\u2019s slider?\n\nProbably the second thing you will notice (if you have ever used WM-enabled devices before) is that the Main Menu of this phone isn\u2019t very WM-ish. No wonder. The main-menu and several other parts of this phone have been re-designed by Samsung. This was Samsung\u2019s attempt to reduce your interaction with the Windows Mobile interface to a minimum.  \n The good: Samsung\u2019s redesigned interface looks awesome. They did an excellent job at creating something that by far surpasses the usability of Windows Mobile. The whole thing clearly was designed with finger interaction in mind (or perhaps not the whole thing but most of it).  \n The bad: It still runs over Windows Mobile and\u2026 newsflash\u2026 Windows Mobile still is **TURTLE SLOW**.  \n The ugly: Did I mention it runs over Windows Mobile? The interface clearly is designed to support finger swipes, but at least with my fingers, I end up pressing buttons I don\u2019t want to more often than I actually get the swipe feature working.\n\nIf you care enough to dive deep into the settings, you\u2019ll find that the black thingy between your call keys can actually work as an optical mouse. Seriously, it is pretty darn cool\u2026 but useless.  \n The good: Innovation. To my knowledge this is the only PDA with a built-in mouse.  \n The bad: It is useless. I wonder what people typically prefer: dragging over a mouse cursor or simply tapping with their fingers. Hmm\u2026  \n The ugly: Having this optical mouse work as D-Pad is simply better than the mouse feature.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it. I am afraid that as far as functionality goes, these are the only points on which Omnia differs from the other brands running Windows Mobile. Fact remains that the Samsung Omnia feels slow and it crashes more than often. With a Divx Certified device I would expect to be able to copy movies into the device and be able to play them out of the box; no dice. It does work well with certain videos, but there are some files that will just instantly crash the device and you are left with a soft-reset.\n\nThis brings us to the next contender: the Nokia \u201ciPhone-killer\u201d 5800.\n\nBefore I delve any further into this phone you must realize something: this phone is by no means an iPhone-killer and there is a reason for this: Nokia.\n\nThe way I see it, Nokia is **the** culprit for the 5800 (or any of their other phones) not becoming as famous and usable as the iPhone. For starters, Nokia uses an archaic development platform that is a pain to work on. Only recently Nokia has started to distribute Carbide.C++ for free and even now it is still a pain in the rear to get an application working on a Nokia. That is without having to take a \u201cCertification 101\u201d course.\n\nThen there\u2019s the second thing that upsets me about the Nokia 5800: the hardware. The screen is far too thin (even though they advertise it as nHD \u2013 whatever that is \u2013 nokiaHD maybe?) and, yes guys, it is still a resistive screen. And you know what? Resistive screens are single-touch only. There are some work arounds to get \u00a0some multi-touch functionality going on but it is tricky and it doesn\u2019t work for everything that you\u2019d like it to.\n\nAs a plus, this phone is a Nokia. This brand has an history of making extremely well built phones and even though the phone feels a little lightweight, it certainly is resistant as some recent testing has proven. The 5800 is entirely made of plastic, but it does have a metalic frame on the front face, which gives it some robustency.\n\nIt is true that it is still early in the 5800\u2019s life and it still has a long path ahead until the amount of applications starts growing like it did for the N95 for example. There is however a catch: the 5800 does not have built-in 3D hardware acceleration like the N95 does. I am pretty sure that this will significantly limit the amount of games that will be able to be ported over from the N95.\n\nThe fact that 5800 is still so young also has influence over another factor: the bugs. The current v20 firmware is **extremely** buggy.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Today I bring you a head-to-head comparison of two smartphones.

You know, I also have a DVD burner with lightscribe which is the next best thing these days and did I mention that I have an integrated card-reader, a webcam and an HDMI output?!

Yes, you don\u2019t really have to grip it like Steve J. suggests, you really just have to touch it on that joint point on the bottom left corner of the phone and the signal goes all the way down to just two, and then one bar. You can clearly see the effects of the new firmware though, it no longer goes into no signal, it will still tell you that there\u2019s some signal, while in fact it\u2019s probably impossible to make any calls at that point. But anyway, I was there, I tested it. I didn\u2019t grip the iPhone, I merely pressed my index finger against that tiny little spot and the signal instantly started dropping from the full five bars to two bars and ultimately to just one bar. Similarly, as soon as I raised my finger from that spot, it gained back the signal to full strength.

Still, the screen of the iPhone 4 is just\u2026 fantastic. It\u2019s something that has to be seen in person to be wooed by it and trust me, you will be.\n\nAnyway, enough beating the dead horse with a stick and moving on to more serious matters. I\u2019ve had my eye on the Samsung Galaxy S for a while now and based on the reviews and videos I saw of it, I was pretty much convinced on getting one. I had a few deals on eBay that I was keeping track of \u00a0and I was just waiting for my own phone to sell to then buy the Galaxy. However, what was not my surprise when on the O2 store, I saw the Samsung Galaxy S for sale and it had actually been one of the motives for me to go up to the store: I wanted to try the phone in person just to get the feel of it. I asked the lady if she had one other than that one on display as it had no battery and she went to get one, a BNIB handset, just for me to try. I was impressed with her amiability with this and I had the chance to take a glance at the price tag \u2013 \u00a3319 it read. I thought to myself that it was a really nice price but it was probably locked to O2, which isn\u2019t desirable at all for me. I\u2019m at a point in my life that I might have to move to God knows where and having a phone that\u2019s locked to a British network is anything but ideal for me.\n\nThe lady came back with the handset and she let me mess around with it a bit. I tried (and failed) to enable Swype, and on a casual chit chat with the O2 lady, I asked her whether the phone was locked and she told me she didn\u2019t actually know. Those phones were supposed to be sold on contracts and those are usually unlocked, but she didn\u2019t know. She also told me that she was fairly sure they were unlocked, as the box had no O2 branding whatsoever, but she didn\u2019t know for sure. After asking a few of her colleagues, none of them seemed to be sure either but at some point, one of them assured me it was unlocked to all networks, and I just knew it: I have to buy this phone. And I did. I made an excellent deal, better than any of the deals on eBay because I get 1 year warranty and in the end it\u2019s actually cheaper than anything on eBay.\n\nSo, to everyone who\u2019s wanting to buy a Samsung Galaxy S, I say try your local O2 shop.

This move was led by several reasons that I am not going to go in detail in this post now but I did it and I was very happy with my new phone. In comparison with the Nokia it was super fast and best of all, it runs Android which is, in my opinion, a great mobile operating system.\n\nNow, all was well until I started hearing about these supposed lag issues of the Galaxy S and I honestly didn\u2019t know what it was all about. The phone seemed fast enough for me and I was generally very happy with it. Sure, sometimes it would hang for 2 or 3 seconds but nothing to worrying. I genuinely thought it was just normal hiccups like we sometimes get on our computers.\n\nEverything changed when I decided to give one of the lag fixes a go. I thought \u201chey, why not?\u201d, I had wanted to root my device for a while now so I could just as well go the extra mile and apply the lag fix as well, and boy, was I missing on speed. After rooting and applying the patch everything is just snappy. There\u2019s no more hiccups at all and apps just load instantly without any wait at all. For example, when I refresh my inbox using GMail it also takes WAY LESS time than it would before, which really surprised me. Browsing also feels faster and even the benchmarking tool \u201cQuadrant Standard\u201d reports the Galaxy S as being twice as fast as the Motorola Droid X! Actually, with this fix, the Galaxy S is at the top of the food chain with the closest phone to provide even similar results being the Nexus One on Froyo.\n\nSo my advice is: apply this patch asap. It will eat 1Gb of your internal memory card but trust me: it\u2019s so very worth it. I\u2019m including two videos in this post. One of them teaches you how to root the phone while the other guides you through the actual fix. Just apply them both (first root then fix) and off you go.\n\nIf you notice the phone to be faster, please drop me a comment below.\n\nCheers!\n\n**Update:**\n\nI know I have the videos below and they\u2019re pretty straight forward, but since this post is getting so much popularity, I thought I\u2019d make a step by step walkthrough that will guide you through the whole process of rooting AND applying the lag fix. Let\u2019s start with the rooting, shall we?\n\nThe next steps are for **ROOTING** your Samsung Galaxy S (i9000):\n\n1. Download this file: [update](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/update.zip).zip\n2. Plug your phone to your computer and mount the memory cards through the notification bar.\n3. Place this update.zip in the root of your INTERNAL SD card. It should be the one with lots of folders. Just place it right in the card, outside any particular folder.\n4. Unmount the USB connection through the notification bar.\n5. Turn off your phone.\n6. With your phone turned off, press the following keys at the same time: Volume Up, Home and Power button. Keep holding them until you see the Samsung Galaxy S writings on the screen, then you can let go.\n7. You will be presented with a menu, just choose the option that allows you to flash the update.zip using the volume up and volume down keys. To select the option just push the home key.\n8. Wait for the phone to reboot on its own et voil\u00e0! It\u2019s done!\n\nThe next steps are for **APPLYING THE LAG FIX** onto\u00a0your Samsung Galaxy S (i9000):\n\nOk, so I cheated. I\u2019m not going to give you steps for this because\u2026. it\u2019s the same as the steps above! So, **if you have already rooted your phone**, repeat the steps above **BUT** with this [update](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/update1.zip). **WARNING: ** The name of this second file is update1.zip. You **MUST** take the \u201c1\u201d off before you copy it to your phone, otherwise it will NOT work! You also need to know that possibly you won\u2019t see the \u201c.zip\u201d extension. This is fine! If you don\u2019t see it, DON\u2019T add it!

This move was led by several reasons that I am not going to go in detail in this post now but I did it and I was very happy with my new phone. In comparison with the Nokia it was super fast and best of all, it runs Android which is, in my opinion, a great mobile operating system.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><!--more-->Now, all was well until I started hearing about these supposed lag issues of the Galaxy S and I honestly didn&#8217;t know what it was all about. The phone seemed fast enough for me and I was generally very happy with it. Sure, sometimes it would hang for 2 or 3 seconds but nothing to worrying. I genuinely thought it was just normal hiccups like we sometimes get on our computers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Everything changed when I decided to give one of the lag fixes a go. I thought &#8220;hey, why not?&#8221;, I had wanted to root my device for a while now so I could just as well go the extra mile and apply the lag fix as well, and boy, was I missing on speed. After rooting and applying the patch everything is just snappy. There&#8217;s no more hiccups at all and apps just load instantly without any wait at all. For example, when I refresh my inbox using GMail it also takes WAY LESS time than it would before, which really surprised me. Browsing also feels faster and even the benchmarking tool &#8220;Quadrant Standard&#8221; reports the Galaxy S as being twice as fast as the Motorola Droid X! Actually, with this fix, the Galaxy S is at the top of the food chain with the closest phone to provide even similar results being the Nexus One on Froyo.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So my advice is: apply this patch asap. It will eat 1Gb of your internal memory card but trust me: it&#8217;s so very worth it. I&#8217;m including two videos in this post. One of them teaches you how to root the phone while the other guides you through the actual fix. Just apply them both (first root then fix) and off you go.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you notice the phone to be faster, please drop me a comment below.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cheers!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Update:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know I have the videos below and they&#8217;re pretty straight forward, but since this post is getting so much popularity, I thought I&#8217;d make a step by step walkthrough that will guide you through the whole process of rooting AND applying the lag fix. Let&#8217;s start with the rooting, shall we?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The next steps are for <strong>ROOTING<\/strong> your Samsung Galaxy S (i9000):<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download this file: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/update.zip\">update<\/a>.zip<\/li>\n<li>Plug your phone to your computer and mount the memory cards through the notification bar.<\/li>\n<li>Place this update.zip in the root of your INTERNAL SD card. It should be the one with lots of folders. Just place it right in the card, outside any particular folder.<\/li>\n<li>Unmount the USB connection through the notification bar.<\/li>\n<li>Turn off your phone.<\/li>\n<li>With your phone turned off, press the following keys at the same time: Volume Up, Home and Power button. Keep holding them until you see the Samsung Galaxy S writings on the screen, then you can let go.<\/li>\n<li>You will be presented with a menu, just choose the option that allows you to flash the update.zip using the volume up and volume down keys. To select the option just push the home key.<\/li>\n<li>Wait for the phone to reboot on its own et voil\u00e0! It&#8217;s done!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The next steps are for <strong>APPLYING THE LAG FIX<\/strong> onto\u00a0your Samsung Galaxy S (i9000):<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ok, so I cheated. I&#8217;m not going to give you steps for this because&#8230;. it&#8217;s the same as the steps above! So, <strong>if you have already rooted your phone<\/strong>, repeat the steps above <strong>BUT<\/strong> with this <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/update1.zip\">update<\/a>. <strong>WARNING: <\/strong> The name of this second file is update1.zip.

You just have to be aware that these builds are in fact beta builds released by Samsung and thus might still be a bit buggy and crash-ey. Still, it shouldn\u2019t break your phone. If anything you\u2019ll just have to reflash it back with \u00c9clair which is perfectly possible and very safe.\n\nSo you want to give these Froyo builds a try? After all there are already **three** betas out there so it can\u2019t be that bad, right? Well, just read on for a walk through on how to get these builds and how to get them on your phone!For this walk through I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019ve never flashed a firmware \u201cthrough the back door\u201d before. Essentially there are two ways of flashing a firmware onto the Samsung Galaxy S. You can either use Samsung Kies which is an application very much like Nokia\u2019s PC Suite, or you can use Odin. Odin is a hacker\u2019s tool. It\u2019s not an official tool by Samsung but instead it\u2019s a tool that allows you to flash any firmware you want, as long as you have the files for it. To flash these Froyo betas we are, obviously, using Odin.\n\nFirst and foremost you should obtain all the files that you need, so here\u2019s a list of what you\u2019re going to need during the process:\n\n1. Odin \u2013 the flasher tool\n2. Either the 512 or the 513 PIT file (read after step 4 to know which one you need)\n3. You get both the above tools by [clicking here](https:\/\/www.wuala.com\/Samsung%20Galaxy%20S\/Firewares%20,%20Updates%20and%20Odin\/Odin%20&%20Bootloader(.PIT)\/?key=AfzUZSU4SpKU).\n4. The firmware that you want to flash.\n\nYou can get the latest Froyo build at the time of writing (i9000XXJP3) by going here: [Rapidshare](http:\/\/rapidshare.com\/files\/415790394\/I9000XXJP3.7z). Now, as far as the PIT files go, normally you need the 512 file but some firmwares will require the 513. For this XXJP3, you will need the **512 PIT file** which you can get from the link on step 3.\n\nAfter you have downloaded all the files, make sure you **UNPLUG YOUR PHONE** from your computer.\n\nNow, here\u2019s all the steps you need to get to the actual flashing:\n\n1. Turn off your phone and remove your SIM and SD cards.\n2. Hold the following buttons at the same time: Volume Down, Home and Power button.\n3. After doing the step above, your screen should say \u201cDownload mode\u201d.\n4. Fire up Odin **BEFORE** you plug your phone to the USB port.\n5. Plug the phone with the USB cord.\n\nAfter step 5, Odin should detect your Galaxy S and it should acknowledge the connection where it says \u201cID:COM\u201d.\n\nWhen Odin has recognized your phone, you need to load all the files you\u2019ve downloaded. Keep in mind that the firmware has to be extracted and in it you will find three files: the CSC, the [Modem\/Phone] and the [PDA\/Code]. Load all the files in their respective slots on Odin and load the 512 PIT file as well. After you\u2019ve done this, just press \u201cStart\u201d and let it rip \ud83d\ude42 it will take a while and **DO NOT** remove the cable before the process is completed. You will know once the process is completed as Odin will tell you it has finished and your phone will boot back up normally. Keep in mind that the phone will reboot at least once and you should still let it do its thing before it\u2019s come to a full stop.\n\nAfter this is done, just enjoy your new Froyo phone \ud83d\ude00\n\n**WORD OF ADVICE:** After you\u2019ve switched to Android 2.2 Froyo, the method I described in my other post on how to root and apply the lag fix on the phone **no longer will work**. To root and apply the lag fix you will need to use a different method so please, don\u2019t try to use that on a Froyo Galaxy S.\n\n**ALSO\u2026!:** I\u2019m not to be held responsible if you brick your phone in the process of flashing firmwares. I\u2019m just providing some guidance which if for some reason does not work for you, I am not to be held accountable.\n\nHappy flashing!\n\n\n","html":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/froyogalaxy.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-370\" title=\"froyogalaxy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/froyogalaxy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"216\" height=\"217\" \/><\/a>In case you were not aware yet, there are Froyo builds available out there <strong>RIGHT NOW<\/strong> for the Samsung Galaxy S.

First and foremost we heard about the new version of the iOS! That\u2019s right, iOS 4.2 is coming out November 2010 and it will come out not only for the iPhone 4 but also for the\u2026. YES, you guessed right! FOR THE iPAD!\n\nDid I get you curious with the new things announced at this Apple event? Well then, keep on reading to get the rest of the story!The iOS 4.2 will bring your normal improvements that come with every release and it will also include this new feature Apple dubbed as \u201cAirPlay\u201d. AirPlay is essentially a way for you to stream any kind of content from your iPhone\/iPad into the new Apple TV. So that\u2019s all for the iOS 4.2 \u2013 AirPlay and finally an iPad version. This means we\u2019ll finally get multitasking on our iPads. Ace!\n\nNext up were the iPods. Steve claimed Apple had redesigned their whole iPod line-up and so they did! There\u2019s this new iPod shuffle that is smaller and comes in all these neat colours. This is basically just a reiteration of the shuffle design with no screen and a wheel with a few buttons to play, pause and skip tracks. The cheapest version will sport 2Gb of internal memory and\u00a0[it will go for $49](http:\/\/store.apple.com\/us\/browse\/home\/shop_ipod\/family\/ipod_shuffle?mco=MTM3NDkzMDI). No word if there will be versions with larger memory.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/09\/design_finger20100901.jpg \"design_finger20100901\")](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/09\/design_finger20100901.jpg)The most amazing revamp they did, however, was with the iPod Nano. They got rid of the wheel below the screen and they\u2019ve made the screen smaller\u2026. and touch capable! The new iPod Nano is now a cute little square with a touch screen. Quite cool! There are two versions of this, one at 8Gb and the other at 16Gb, [which cost $149 and $179](http:\/\/store.apple.com\/us\/browse\/home\/shop_ipod\/family\/ipod_nano?mco=MTM3NDcwMTA) respectively.\n\nFinally on the iPod market, Apple has also made the predicted move. They\u2019ve released an iPhone-4-esque version of the [iPod Touch](http:\/\/store.apple.com\/us\/browse\/home\/shop_ipod\/family\/ipod_touch?mco=MTM3NDY2Mzg). It now comes with a 5 megapixel camera on the back, a front-facing camera and you guessed it right: Facetime capabilities. The new iPod Touch will also support the AirPlay, as will all devices with the new iOS4.2.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/09\/itunes-10-and-ping-take-on-facebook.jpg \"itunes-10-and-ping-take-on-facebook\")](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/09\/itunes-10-and-ping-take-on-facebook.jpg)Along with the news for today also came the new version of iTunes. The new iTunes 10 will come with a new logo, as according to Steve it wouldn\u2019t make sense to have the CD on it anymore. Considering that the logo had been designed 10 years ago (according to Mr. Jobs) then I\u2019m compelled to agree with him; not that I find the new logo much more attractive, but hey, it\u2019s a matter of taste. The new iTunes also brings a social networking service for music called Ping. Apparently, Ping \u201cis not Facebook, it is not Twitter, it\u2019s a social networking service for music\u201d. I\u2019m still not entirely sold on the idea but the notion seems to be sharing what you\u2019re listening to and what you\u2019ve downloaded. It seems to me this will be Apple\u2019s own last.fm, with direct integration with iOS.\n\nFinally, Uncle Steve introduced the new Apple TV. Their new TV box is much smaller than their previous iteration and it will integrate with the AirPlay present on the iOS. Apparently they got some feedback from their customers and the new service will be more rental-oriented and the prices will go significantly down to compensate for this. With the new service you\u2019ll get newly released films for just $4.99 and TV show episodes for $0.99 \u2013 a bargain, I say. Makes me wish I was living in the US\u2026\n\nThe new Apple TV service will also support Netflix streaming which means that if you\u2019re a subscriber, you\u2019ll be able to stream contents directly into your television. Still on the streaming front, the new iTunes will also allow people to stream stuff directly into the Apple TV, without much fuss. That\u2019s a neat little feature that\u2019s been around with the XBOX 360 for a while now and Apple has their own version built right into the Apple TV.\n\nThe Apple event had to finish on a high note and as such they invited Chris Martin to put on a small show for the audience.

I read a lot\u00a0of articles on how to root my phone but I just couldn\u2019t see what benefits I would get from it. I had had an iPhone and I knew the benefits I could get from jailbreaking, but I just didn\u2019t know what I could get from rooting.\n\nWell, rooting is in its definition a way to obtain root access to your phone. Does this still not tell you much? Good, then read on.\n\nThis was the geek definition. Now, translating this into English, it means that some applications (some of them widely available in the Android Market), require some deeper privileges to work. Applications like Wireless Tether or Quick Boot are just a few examples of these apps.\n\nBy rooting your phone, it won\u2019t become faster but it won\u2019t become slower either. What rooting means is that you\u2019ll have the **option** to grant some applications more access than they would normally have.\n\nNow, as to knowing whether your phone is rooted or not, that\u2019s a quite simple task. A rooted Android phone will have an additional application (installed automatically upon the rooting process), that is called \u201cSuperuser Permissions\u201d. You don\u2019t need to use this app but just the fact alone that it sits there, gives you this possibility. If an application ever requires root permissions, you will get a notice saying that the app is requesting super user permissions. Obviously, if you trust the app you will grant these permissions \u2013 if you don\u2019t trust it, you\u2019ll deny them.\n\n\n","html":"<p><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-410\" title=\"root Android\" src=\"http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/09\/root-Android.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the things I had a hard trouble finding an answer for after I got my first Android phone was: what is all this deal with rooting?

Does this still not tell you much? Good, then read on.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This was the geek definition. Now, translating this into English, it means that some applications (some of them widely available in the Android Market), require some deeper privileges to work. Applications like Wireless Tether or Quick Boot are just a few examples of these apps.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By rooting your phone, it won&#8217;t become faster but it won&#8217;t become slower either. What rooting means is that you&#8217;ll have the <strong>option<\/strong> to grant some applications more access than they would normally have.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, as to knowing whether your phone is rooted or not, that&#8217;s a quite simple task. A rooted Android phone will have an additional application (installed automatically upon the rooting process), that is called &#8220;Superuser Permissions&#8221;. You don&#8217;t need to use this app but just the fact alone that it sits there, gives you this possibility. If an application ever requires root permissions, you will get a notice saying that the app is requesting super user permissions. Obviously, if you trust the app you will grant these permissions &#8211; if you don&#8217;t trust it, you&#8217;ll deny them.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Wed, 15 Sep 2010 00:24:33 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Wed, 15 Sep 2010 00:24:33 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Wed, 15 Sep 2010 00:24:33 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":412,"title":"Free Storage With Dropbox (Free Online Backups)","slug":"free-storage-with-dropbox-free-online-backups","markdown":"\n[![](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/09\/dropbox.png \"dropbox\")](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/09\/dropbox.png)If you need a way to store your files in a manner that they are always accessible everywhere, then Dropbox is for you.

Answer-finding, correct? We are part of a generation that mindlessly presses CTRL + T to open a new tab in our browser of choice, points it to [www.google.com](http:\/\/www.google.com) and types away whatever question we need an answer for. Then comes the tedious process of sorting through all the results in hopes of truly finding the answer to what we\u2019re looking for. Typically, in a good day, we will find a link that contains the answer to our question, use the answer and ditch the browser tab. Does this sound like something you do more than once a day? Well, then read on.\n\nWhat if we could make this process better? Oftentimes, I\u2019ll require the answer to my question more than once and most of the times I just can\u2019t be bothered with bookmarking the page.

I\u2019m wasting time more than once to find answers for the same information and \u2013 drawing on my recently developed and work-in-progress Dutch skills \u2013\u00a0*dat kan niet*.\n\nWhy don\u2019t we make search engines smarter? Let\u2019s look at an example.\n\nI\u2019m a hobbyist guitar player and every now and then, I\u2019ll go to Google and search for \u201csoldier of love tab\u201d. Then I\u2019ll search through all the guitar tab sites and I finally find that one tab that is actually well written and faithful to the original song. Brilliant. I open it, I play it by myself once, I pretend to be an epic guitarist by playing along to the MP3 of the original and I close the tab feeling proud that I can play the guitar. But then, the next weekend comes and my girlfriend comes to visit. Of course, being the romantic guy that I am, I want to play for her but damn\u2026 it\u2019s going to take me long to find that really good guitar tab again and alas, the mood is killed. BUT! What if the first time around, I could have told Google \u201c*this link contains the exact answer for \u2018soldier of love tab\u2019* \u201d so that whenever I searched again for this (or similar, e.g. \u2018soldier of love chords\u2019) string, Google would tell me \u201c*hey, you\u2019ve searched for something similar before and you have previously defined answers for this question*\u201c. Wouldn\u2019t this be great?\n\nWouldn\u2019t it also be great if I could even mark specific segments of a result page as containing the answer for my question? Maybe sometimes I\u2019d search \u201chow to list [ant](http:\/\/ant.apache.org\/) targets on the command line?\u201d and I\u2019d select a specific snippet of a website where it says \u201c*ant -p*\u201d as the answer to my question. Then, whenever I\u2019d search for it again, Google would give me **THE answer** rather than links to **potential answers**.\n\nThen we could get crazy with it. Make it anonymously social! \u201c*Other users have searched for a similar question, these are the links they selected as answers*\u201c. Users, by adopting this technique for themselves, would be helping each other as well and soon, the millions (billions?) of people using conventional search engines could eventually turn Google from a **result-based** search engine into an **answer-based** one.\n\nWe would all spend less time searching and we\u2019d all turn more productive by literally having the answers to everything we need at our fingertips.\n\nThat was the basic gist of my idea. Please, Google or Bing engineers, if you read this, you can take this idea. For free. I claim no royalties, copyrights or trademarks\u2026 but it\u2019d be pretty cool if you told me about it in case you use it. Also, in roughly 3.5 years I\u2019ll be finished with my Doctorate degree and I\u2019ll be probably looking for a job.

Maybe sometimes I&#8217;d search &#8220;how to list <a href=\"http:\/\/ant.apache.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">ant<\/a> targets on the command line?&#8221; and I&#8217;d select a specific snippet of a website where it says &#8220;<em>ant -p<\/em>&#8221; as the answer to my question. Then, whenever I&#8217;d search for it again, Google would give me <strong>THE answer<\/strong> rather than links to <strong>potential answers<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then we could get crazy with it. Make it anonymously social! &#8220;<em>Other users have searched for a similar question, these are the links they selected as answers<\/em>&#8220;. Users, by adopting this technique for themselves, would be helping each other as well and soon, the millions (billions?) of people using conventional search engines could eventually turn Google from a <strong>result-based<\/strong> search engine into an <strong>answer-based<\/strong> one.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We would all spend less time searching and we&#8217;d all turn more productive by literally having the answers to everything we need at our fingertips.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That was the basic gist of my idea.

Today was, luckily, one of those days. Not because it was a particularly easy day at work (reengineering someone else\u2019s code with little to non-existing documentation is **never**\u00a0an easy job) but perhaps the intense gym session loosed my brains just enough for organized and coherent thought to just happen. In any case, I digress.\n\nThis post has three main themes. I will be talking about a platform for SOA applications called Turmeric (funny name, I know. I\u2019m using for SOA the same I use in my lentil soup), open-source in general and finally, the Apache Software Foundation and some recent events I\u2019ve been involved in.\n\nI shall begin with [Turmeric SOA](https:\/\/www.ebayopensource.org\/index.php\/Turmeric\/HomePage). Turmeric SOA, despite the strange choice of name, is actually an industry grade platform for web services. Why is it industry grade, you ask? Is it because the developers so claim? Not really. The industry grade designation is actually made by me \u2013 the project (and its developers) do not claim anything about it being industry ready or anything of that kind. I should mention, however, that Turmeric SOA is the **open-source**\u00a0version of the platform that powers eBay. Yes, you read that right, THE eBay. In my book, if a platform handles the millions of customers all over the world that eBay does, that platform is pretty much as industry-grade as it gets these days.\n\nWhy am I talking about Turmeric SOA? Why am I even involved in Turmeric SOA?\n\nIt\u2019s very simple really and it all points back to my work as a Ph.D. student at the [Delft University of Technology](http:\/\/www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl\/~tiago\/). My research, in broad terms consists of analyzing and coming up with new ways of helping the maintenance, reengineering and testing of Service Oriented Architectures. In this description, I\u2019ve cleverly omitted the keyword that defines my research, mostly because it\u2019s a vague buzzword that means different things to different people (in case you\u2019re wondering, the word is *multi-tenancy*). In any case, my research involving SOA only makes sense if I have a software system on which I can investigate and demonstrate my claims and this is where it all gets hairy.\n\nThe fact is that for most companies, SOA simply means exposing some of their data through an API built on top of SOAP or REST, et voil\u00e0. All of a sudden they can claim that they are a company of the future because they have a SOA system. This, however, couldn\u2019t be farther from what an actual SOA system should be. We can even take the etymological angle and look at what SOA means: Service Oriented **Architecture**. I\u2019ve emphasized the word \u201carchitecture\u201d as I believe that is the keyword in the SOA acronym. Your SOA system should be built using an architectural style consistent with that of services that communicate with each other. It should be oriented towards\/based on services, and not a monolithic blob with one tiny service gateway that allows me to query some data, even if that data is provided in a platform-agnostic manner. To people who have such monolithic SOA-wannabe systems, I ask: can I slice part of your software and place it elsewhere in the world with an Internet connection on both ends? If I can\u2019t, what if your user-base or your business grow to a point where one server no longer cuts it? What do you do then? Keep buying bigger motherboards with more CPU and RAM sockets?\n\nLet\u2019s get real here. Your software system is service-oriented if I can grab all the pieces that compose it and spread it all over the world. The only thing I should have to tell the software system is: \u201cyou have service A deployed at this endpoint, service B at this other endpoint, etc etc\u201d and then it would automagically just work, regardless of whether the services are running in the same application server or in each other\u2019s antipodes in completely opposite timezones.\n\nSo why am I bringing this up? Well, as it stands it\u2019s difficult enough to find open-source systems that are truly built around a service-oriented architecture. For most of these services, SOA is an afterthought. It\u2019s something those open-source ERP developers woke up one day and thought \u201chey, wouldn\u2019t it be cool if our ERP had some SOA features?\u201d \u2013 and alas, the result is invariably slamming some poorly engineered JAXWS or Axis2 solution on top of already existing business logic and inevitably making a mess of a perfectly fine (albeit, poorly scaling) software system.\n\nFrom my own experience, this is the summary of most open-source ERP systems out there that claim to have some kind of SOA functionality.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t cut it for us. This is not what the SOA paradigm truly stands for and these systems are ultimately useless for my research. There\u2019s only one web service! How the hell is it supposed to communicate with anything? Its business logic is ultimately still relying on local method calls.\n\nThen out of this hell comes another frightening fact. Even the web service platforms out there are useless on their own. I was chatting with a friend of mine \u2013 who\u2019s not a computer scientist \u2013 the other day, and I was struggling to explain to her what exactly my problem was without using terms such as JAXWS, Turmeric, web services or SOA. I think I came up with a clear laymen explanation involving the process of building a car. So, my problem right now is that I need a very specific type of car, say, one that is rocket propelled. There are, of course, brands out there that have rocket propelled cars but there\u2019s no way on Earth that these guys are gonna let me even LOOK at their car, set aside open the hood and disassemble its engine. Yet, my research consists of analyzing the problems and challenges of maintaining a rocket propelled car. But I have no car, and no means to get one. This is a pretty big inconvenience. Not even me promising this car brand that I won\u2019t build a competitor car, or destroy their car will convince them to let me pop the hood \u2013 and so, Houston, we have a problem.\n\nThe solution to this problem is seemingly simple. I can just build my own rocket propelled car and hope for the best. But then we run into a more essential problem: I\u2019m not a car maker, nor does my department pay me to make cars. Also, if by the end of my Ph.D. I\u2019ve only built a rocket propelled car, they\u2019re not gonna be happy.\n\nI could also cut some corners and build a mockup of a rocket propelled car. Sure, maybe it doesn\u2019t have a gearbox and the steering wheel is made of cardboard, but hey! It\u2019s a rocket propelled car! This would be swell, if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that even the free tools I can get out there to make cars are pretty\u2026 well\u2026 horrible. Stepping back out of the metaphor world, the problem is that the technologies available allow me to build simple web services. I can just grab Java\u2019s Metro project (aka JAXWS) and very easily deploy a web service, but that\u2019s just what it is. A web service, accessible via SOAP, amidst nothingness. There\u2019s nothing I can query to know that this service is there, there\u2019s no platform managing this service and telling me that it has *this many*\u00a0services and that *this particular one*\u00a0is one of them, there\u2019s no statistics or runtime information being kept on this service, there\u2019s basically\u2026 nothing. Just a Java class with a \u201cWebService\u201d sticker on it.\n\nThese tools make it difficult to build something that even resembles a real world SOA system (i.e. a rocket propelled car). They\u2019re the tiniest building blocks that you can think of. The sand in the car\u2019s windshield or the iron ore in the chassis\u2019 stainless steel. Sure, I can melt the sand, add some caustic soda and fashion my own windshield out of it. I can melt the iron ore and through some process I don\u2019t even know, make steel. But how long is this going to take me? And will the final result be a faithful representation of what actual companies in this line of work have made? Or just a silly toy example that doesn\u2019t fully represent the pains and benefits of such a system?\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/TurmericLogo.jpg \"TurmericLogo\")](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/TurmericLogo.jpg)That\u2019s where Turmeric comes in. My first impression when I started using Turmeric was that of confusion. I thought to myself \u201cwell, that\u2019s another platform with an awful lot of features that no one\u2019s ever going to use\u201d, but I was wrong. Over time, with more thoroughly exploring this platform, it became clear that perhaps every single feature in Turmeric really stemmed from a real world use case, most likely from eBay. All those features, if you really think about it, you\u2019ll end up realizing \u201coh yeah, they probably use this to achieve X and Y\u201d. In other words, even if we don\u2019t have the rocket propelled car, we have the exact tools that we need to build one. Knowing that if the toolset includes a door-shaped mould, it probably means that our car should have at least one door \u2013 for which other reason would those guys have built such a tool if they hadn\u2019t built a door for their car before?\n\nThis makes Turmeric a very good candidate to be used as the tooling for my research. But Turmeric isn\u2019t, in my point of view, a very good candidate anymore. It\u2019s evolved from that into an **excellent** candidate at that! Now it\u2019s the time when I really have to shine a light on **all** the guys behind the task of open-sourcing eBay\u2019s platform. Those guys form a small community of people who usually hang around #turmeric-dev at irc.freenode.net and who just happen to be extremely friendly and helpful. Every time I hit a road bump with Turmeric, these guys go out of their ways to help me achieve the things I\u2019m trying to achieve and I think that\u2019s a lot more than I could have ever asked for.\n\nQuickly moving to the topic of open-source, since Turmeric SOA is actually an open-source project, this made me ever so fond of open-source stuff. It\u2019s really nice to see all these people dedicated in making such a tremendous contribution that is open-sourcing a platform from eBay to the good of the community. I love that. I love being able to \u2013 should I need \u2013 download a relational database management system from Apache without having to pay for it. I love seeing projects like Ubuntu flourish, showing companies that even software is all about the people it\u2019s built to and with a little help, even an open-source can kick big corporations in their royal butts.\n\nAll this to say that I\u2019ve learned a whole lot over the last few days. Amongst the things I\u2019ve learned is for example, git. The cool kids\u2019 versioning system. As Turmeric nowadays relies on Git for its version management, I thought now would be a good time to learn it and see what advantages it brings over SVN \u2013 and boy, does it leave SVN in its rear view mirror! I\u2019ve grown so much accustomed to it that I\u2019ve started moving my projects to Git as well and I\u2019ve been trying to influence other people around me to use it (Andy, if you\u2019re reading this, wink wink, nudge nudge ;)). The saddest part of it all is that, in my opinion, you don\u2019t really fully understand the advantages it brings until you really give it a try with real source code that you must maintain in collaboration with other people.\n\nGoing on a bit of a tangent, Git (and open-source) has also enabled me to propose some enhancements to David Carver\u2019s (Turmeric SOA\u2019s top man) IRC bot that idles around #turmeric-dev \u2013 all via the clever features of Github, forking and pull requesting.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/46833_425136126860_586946860_5624931_1569623_n.jpg \"46833_425136126860_586946860_5624931_1569623_n\")](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/46833_425136126860_586946860_5624931_1569623_n.jpg)To finalize, the Apache Software Foundation. I\u2019m gonna make it short and sweet. As of a couple of days ago, my fellow open-sourcers at Apache Derby decided to vote me to become a PMC (Program Management Committee) member for the Apache DB project. I have, of course, accepted and it is a post I will do my best to honor and live up to.

Today was, luckily, one of those days. Not because it was a particularly easy day at work (reengineering someone else&#8217;s code with little to non-existing documentation is <strong>never<\/strong>\u00a0an easy job) but perhaps the intense gym session loosed my brains just enough for organized and coherent thought to just happen. In any case, I digress.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This post has three main themes. I will be talking about a platform for SOA applications called Turmeric (funny name, I know. I&#8217;m using for SOA the same I use in my lentil soup), open-source in general and finally, the Apache Software Foundation and some recent events I&#8217;ve been involved in.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I shall begin with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebayopensource.org\/index.php\/Turmeric\/HomePage\">Turmeric SOA<\/a>. Turmeric SOA, despite the strange choice of name, is actually an industry grade platform for web services. Why is it industry grade, you ask? Is it because the developers so claim? Not really. The industry grade designation is actually made by me &#8211; the project (and its developers) do not claim anything about it being industry ready or anything of that kind. I should mention, however, that Turmeric SOA is the <strong>open-source<\/strong>\u00a0version of the platform that powers eBay. Yes, you read that right, THE eBay. In my book, if a platform handles the millions of customers all over the world that eBay does, that platform is pretty much as industry-grade as it gets these days.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why am I talking about Turmeric SOA? Why am I even involved in Turmeric SOA?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&#8217;s very simple really and it all points back to my work as a Ph.D. student at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl\/~tiago\/\">Delft University of Technology<\/a>. My research, in broad terms consists of analyzing and coming up with new ways of helping the maintenance, reengineering and testing of Service Oriented Architectures. In this description, I&#8217;ve cleverly omitted the keyword that defines my research, mostly because it&#8217;s a vague buzzword that means different things to different people (in case you&#8217;re wondering, the word is <em>multi-tenancy<\/em>). In any case, my research involving SOA only makes sense if I have a software system on which I can investigate and demonstrate my claims and this is where it all gets hairy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The fact is that for most companies, SOA simply means exposing some of their data through an API built on top of SOAP or REST, et voil\u00e0. All of a sudden they can claim that they are a company of the future because they have a SOA system. This, however, couldn&#8217;t be farther from what an actual SOA system should be. We can even take the etymological angle and look at what SOA means: Service Oriented <strong>Architecture<\/strong>. I&#8217;ve emphasized the word &#8220;architecture&#8221; as I believe that is the keyword in the SOA acronym. Your SOA system should be built using an architectural style consistent with that of services that communicate with each other. It should be oriented towards\/based on services, and not a monolithic blob with one tiny service gateway that allows me to query some data, even if that data is provided in a platform-agnostic manner. To people who have such monolithic SOA-wannabe systems, I ask: can I slice part of your software and place it elsewhere in the world with an Internet connection on both ends? If I can&#8217;t, what if your user-base or your business grow to a point where one server no longer cuts it? What do you do then? Keep buying bigger motherboards with more CPU and RAM sockets?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let&#8217;s get real here. Your software system is service-oriented if I can grab all the pieces that compose it and spread it all over the world. The only thing I should have to tell the software system is: &#8220;you have service A deployed at this endpoint, service B at this other endpoint, etc etc&#8221; and then it would automagically just work, regardless of whether the services are running in the same application server or in each other&#8217;s antipodes in completely opposite timezones.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So why am I bringing this up? Well, as it stands it&#8217;s difficult enough to find open-source systems that are truly built around a service-oriented architecture. For most of these services, SOA is an afterthought. It&#8217;s something those open-source ERP developers woke up one day and thought &#8220;hey, wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if our ERP had some SOA features?&#8221; &#8211; and alas, the result is invariably slamming some poorly engineered JAXWS or Axis2 solution on top of already existing business logic and inevitably making a mess of a perfectly fine (albeit, poorly scaling) software system.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From my own experience, this is the summary of most open-source ERP systems out there that claim to have some kind of SOA functionality.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This doesn&#8217;t cut it for us. This is not what the SOA paradigm truly stands for and these systems are ultimately useless for my research. There&#8217;s only one web service! How the hell is it supposed to communicate with anything? Its business logic is ultimately still relying on local method calls.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then out of this hell comes another frightening fact. Even the web service platforms out there are useless on their own. I was chatting with a friend of mine &#8211; who&#8217;s not a computer scientist &#8211; the other day, and I was struggling to explain to her what exactly my problem was without using terms such as JAXWS, Turmeric, web services or SOA. I think I came up with a clear laymen explanation involving the process of building a car. So, my problem right now is that I need a very specific type of car, say, one that is rocket propelled. There are, of course, brands out there that have rocket propelled cars but there&#8217;s no way on Earth that these guys are gonna let me even LOOK at their car, set aside open the hood and disassemble its engine. Yet, my research consists of analyzing the problems and challenges of maintaining a rocket propelled car. But I have no car, and no means to get one. This is a pretty big inconvenience. Not even me promising this car brand that I won&#8217;t build a competitor car, or destroy their car will convince them to let me pop the hood &#8211; and so, Houston, we have a problem.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The solution to this problem is seemingly simple. I can just build my own rocket propelled car and hope for the best. But then we run into a more essential problem: I&#8217;m not a car maker, nor does my department pay me to make cars. Also, if by the end of my Ph.D. I&#8217;ve only built a rocket propelled car, they&#8217;re not gonna be happy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I could also cut some corners and build a mockup of a rocket propelled car. Sure, maybe it doesn&#8217;t have a gearbox and the steering wheel is made of cardboard, but hey! It&#8217;s a rocket propelled car! This would be swell, if it wasn&#8217;t for the fact that even the free tools I can get out there to make cars are pretty&#8230; well&#8230; horrible. Stepping back out of the metaphor world, the problem is that the technologies available allow me to build simple web services. I can just grab Java&#8217;s Metro project (aka JAXWS) and very easily deploy a web service, but that&#8217;s just what it is. A web service, accessible via SOAP, amidst nothingness. There&#8217;s nothing I can query to know that this service is there, there&#8217;s no platform managing this service and telling me that it has <em>this many<\/em>\u00a0services and that <em>this particular one<\/em>\u00a0is one of them, there&#8217;s no statistics or runtime information being kept on this service, there&#8217;s basically&#8230; nothing. Just a Java class with a &#8220;WebService&#8221; sticker on it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These tools make it difficult to build something that even resembles a real world SOA system (i.e. a rocket propelled car). They&#8217;re the tiniest building blocks that you can think of. The sand in the car&#8217;s windshield or the iron ore in the chassis&#8217; stainless steel. Sure, I can melt the sand, add some caustic soda and fashion my own windshield out of it. I can melt the iron ore and through some process I don&#8217;t even know, make steel. But how long is this going to take me? And will the final result be a faithful representation of what actual companies in this line of work have made? Or just a silly toy example that doesn&#8217;t fully represent the pains and benefits of such a system?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/TurmericLogo.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-498\" title=\"TurmericLogo\" src=\"http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/TurmericLogo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"214\" height=\"117\" \/><\/a>That&#8217;s where Turmeric comes in. My first impression when I started using Turmeric was that of confusion. I thought to myself &#8220;well, that&#8217;s another platform with an awful lot of features that no one&#8217;s ever going to use&#8221;, but I was wrong. Over time, with more thoroughly exploring this platform, it became clear that perhaps every single feature in Turmeric really stemmed from a real world use case, most likely from eBay. All those features, if you really think about it, you&#8217;ll end up realizing &#8220;oh yeah, they probably use this to achieve X and Y&#8221;. In other words, even if we don&#8217;t have the rocket propelled car, we have the exact tools that we need to build one. Knowing that if the toolset includes a door-shaped mould, it probably means that our car should have at least one door &#8211; for which other reason would those guys have built such a tool if they hadn&#8217;t built a door for their car before?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This makes Turmeric a very good candidate to be used as the tooling for my research. But Turmeric isn&#8217;t, in my point of view, a very good candidate anymore. It&#8217;s evolved from that into an <strong>excellent<\/strong> candidate at that! Now it&#8217;s the time when I really have to shine a light on <strong>all<\/strong> the guys behind the task of open-sourcing eBay&#8217;s platform. Those guys form a small community of people who usually hang around #turmeric-dev at irc.freenode.net and who just happen to be extremely friendly and helpful. Every time I hit a road bump with Turmeric, these guys go out of their ways to help me achieve the things I&#8217;m trying to achieve and I think that&#8217;s a lot more than I could have ever asked for.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Quickly moving to the topic of open-source, since Turmeric SOA is actually an open-source project, this made me ever so fond of open-source stuff. It&#8217;s really nice to see all these people dedicated in making such a tremendous contribution that is open-sourcing a platform from eBay to the good of the community. I love that. I love being able to &#8211; should I need &#8211; download a relational database management system from Apache without having to pay for it. I love seeing projects like Ubuntu flourish, showing companies that even software is all about the people it&#8217;s built to and with a little help, even an open-source can kick big corporations in their royal butts.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All this to say that I&#8217;ve learned a whole lot over the last few days. Amongst the things I&#8217;ve learned is for example, git. The cool kids&#8217; versioning system. As Turmeric nowadays relies on Git for its version management, I thought now would be a good time to learn it and see what advantages it brings over SVN &#8211; and boy, does it leave SVN in its rear view mirror! I&#8217;ve grown so much accustomed to it that I&#8217;ve started moving my projects to Git as well and I&#8217;ve been trying to influence other people around me to use it (Andy, if you&#8217;re reading this, wink wink, nudge nudge ;)). The saddest part of it all is that, in my opinion, you don&#8217;t really fully understand the advantages it brings until you really give it a try with real source code that you must maintain in collaboration with other people.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Going on a bit of a tangent, Git (and open-source) has also enabled me to propose some enhancements to David Carver&#8217;s (Turmeric SOA&#8217;s top man) IRC bot that idles around #turmeric-dev &#8211; all via the clever features of Github, forking and pull requesting.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/46833_425136126860_586946860_5624931_1569623_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-499\" title=\"46833_425136126860_586946860_5624931_1569623_n\" src=\"http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/46833_425136126860_586946860_5624931_1569623_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"254\" height=\"259\" \/><\/a>To finalize, the Apache Software Foundation.

It\u2019s as if WSO2 took a page from Microsoft\u2019s book regarding names. What\u2019s next? A Home Edition? Maybe throw in Professional, Business and Ultimate versions too for good measure.\n\nDon\u2019t take me wrong, I have no special feelings towards names themselves, it\u2019s just how difficult it makes to search for people working on the same things and facing the same problems. What do I Google for? WSO2? WSF? PHP? Any combination of these? It\u2019s only made worse by these guys developing frameworks in several platforms, which means I end up finding completely unrelated results from a different implementation, in a different technology.\n\nBut, naming rants aside, I thought it would be a good idea to share my experience with getting this library up and running on PHP. I came across this library when converting Apache Stonehenge\u2019s web application to use Turmeric\u2019s instances of Stonehenge\u2019s web services, and it gave me quite some headaches. For this reason, and so that other people in the future don\u2019t have to go through the same painful experiences, I decided to write this blog post. Keep reading if I got your attention\u2026\n\nFirst and foremost, I should warn that I\u2019m also gonna write the Linux walkthrough and it does expect you to have some basic Linux knowledge. Nothing too advanced, you just need to know your way around a Linux system in a command line. If you meet this criterion, this walkthrough should be a walk in the park (no pun intended there).\n\n### Setting up the library\n\nTo begin with, you must download the WSF PHP library **sources**. You should be able to find it [here](http:\/\/wso2.com\/products\/web-services-framework\/php\/) somewhere. At the time of writing, the latest version is 2.1.0. Make sure you download the **sources**. Sadly, the binaries only include DLL\u2019s for the Windows installation, which means that us, Linux users, must compile our own binaries by hand. No biggie though, it\u2019s easier than it sounds.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve downloaded the library, the next thing you should do is \u201ccd\u201d into the directory. Then, normally you\u2019d just do .\/configure followed by a make and make install, but there\u2019s a caveat: it\u2019s VERY recommended that you specify a prefix when you do .\/configure. The prefix will tell WSO2 where to place the binaries after you compile and \u201cinstall\u201d, and this is extremely useful for WSF as you\u2019ll need a clean directory featuring only the binary files of this library. You\u2019ll understand why in a minute.\n\nIn sum, you should do:\n\n> .\/configure --prefix=\/usr\/local\/bin\/apache2\/php\/wsf-php\/ make [sudo] make install\n\nIn my example you\u2019ll see that I\u2019m telling \u201cmake\u201d to install the library in \/usr\/local\/bin\/apache2\/php\/wsf-php\/ and in the last step I\u2019ve also accounted for those of you who, like me, use Ubuntu. If you use Ubuntu, make sure you add the sudo before the make install command (without brackets).\n\n**Troubleshooting: **If you installed PHP through Ubuntu\u2019s packages, it is possible that everything went fine at this point. If it did (i.e. if you got no errors in neither of the stages) then excellent. Move on. Skip this section. If, on the other hand, you got an error about a missing php-config, then you need to specify the path to this binary in the .\/configure step. First you should know where your PHP installation lies (and you\u2019re entirely on your own for this one) and once you know where it is, your php-config binary is inside <path_to_php>\/bin\/. Once you figured out where that is, you should go back to those three steps above, except your .\/configure should look like:\n\n> .\/configure --prefix=\/usr\/local\/bin\/apache2\/php\/wsf-php\/ --with-php-config=<path_to_php>\/bin\/php-config\n\nAfter this, don\u2019t forget of course, to do the make and make install steps.\n\nWith that done, you should now have the compiled library in\u00a0\/usr\/local\/bin\/apache2\/php\/wsf\/ (or in whichever folder you specified as prefix). You also want to have a look at the final lines of the \u201cmake install\u201d step and look for a reference to a wsf.so file. That\u2019s THE library that PHP will load and you\u2019ll need to know exactly where it is. In my case, the library sits in\u00a0\/usr\/local\/bin\/apache2\/php\/lib\/php\/extensions\/no-debug-non-zts-20090626\/wsf.so . My guess is that the make install step is smart enough to put it in the equivalent folder inside your PHP\u2019s installation. Anyhow, copy this directory.\n\nThe next step involves editing your php.ini file. Again, you should know where this is. After you found it, add the following lines to it:\n\n> extension=\/usr\/local\/bin\/apache2\/php\/lib\/php\/extensions\/no-debug-non-zts-20090626\/wsf.so wsf.home=\"\/usr\/local\/bin\/apache2\/php\/wsf-php\/\"\n\nFrom that you can see that I put the path to the .so file as an extension that PHP must load, and I specified an entry called \u201cwsf.home\u201d that will tell WSF where its \u201cauxiliary\u201d files are. This is the path you used as the prefix during the compiling process. These are the two most essential parameters that need to be configured to get WSF up and running, there\u2019s more but I\u2019m aiming at the quickest way possible to get it running, with as little configuration as possible.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve added those lines, you should restart your Apache et voil\u00e0! Your PHP installation should now have loaded the WSF library. If you want to be sure that everything is up and running, you can check the contents of\u00a0\/tmp\/wsf_php_server.log . If everything went well, this log should have no errors.\n\n### Creating a client and using it\n\nNow comes another **tricky part**. Great, now your library is up and running, but how do you **use it**?\n\nI\u2019m gonna provide another quick and simple explanation of how to get a client up and running for an existing service. This assumes, of course, that you already have a service running somewhere which provides you with a WSDL file and SOAP ports that you can invoke.\n\nProvided you have that, you need to copy a folder in the WSF sources to somewhere safe and accessible by PHP (by accessible, I mean, PHP\/Apache should have at least read and execute permissions). The folder you need is <WSF_sources>\/scripts\/. Copy it somewhere you know it won\u2019t get deleted by an overzealous system administrator and keep it accessible. I would keep it out of public access via Apache but that\u2019s entirely up to you. It\u2019s the next step that is **important**.\n\nNow that you copied this folder (and all its contents) to somewhere safe, you need to go back to your php.ini and add the folder to its include_path definition. In my case, I just uncommented the already existing line and added my scripts folder to it. In the end it looked like:\n\n> include_path = \".:\/php\/includes:\/usr\/local\/bin\/apache2\/php\/scripts\/\"\n\nAfter you\u2019ve added\/uncommented this line, be sure to restart Apache once more. This line will just tell PHP where it can find scripts that WSF will need whenever you\u2019re using its libraries.\n\nWith that out of the way, the next step consists of creating a PHP classmap of all the operations and types you have in your WSDL file. My advice is that you obtain the WSDL file in advance and store it somewhere in your hard-drive. After you\u2019ve done this, just go to the scripts folder and do:\n\n> php wsdl2php.php <path_to_your_wsdl_file>\n\nIt can happen at this step that Linux will tell you it can\u2019t find PHP. If that\u2019s the case, instead of starting off with just \u201cphp\u201d, use the full path instead.\n\nBy doing this step, you\u2019ll see a bunch of PHP code scrolling through your console. If that was the case, repeat the command and redirect the output to a file, e.g. > somefile.php.\n\nThis somefile.php is now your client. It includes a PHP class for every type in your WSDL and an action for every SOAP port. It also includes, at the very end, a sample of how you\u2019d invoke every action. By looking at that you can probably get a good idea of how WSF works, and that\u2019s pretty much it. I assume that if you\u2019re messing around with PHP, you do have enough knowledge to get rid of these sample invokations and just use this file as something you import and use in your PHP application. That\u2019s not going to be covered in this tutorial.\n\nIf you do have questions or ran into trouble while following these steps, please do leave me a comment and I\u2019ll try to answer as soon as possible. I hope this has somehow helped you, reader. I know I wish I had found something like this post when I first started messing around with WSF!\n\nTill the next post!\n\n\n","html":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/762791717WSO2pic.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-523\" title=\"762791717WSO2pic\" src=\"http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/762791717WSO2pic.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"102\" \/><\/a>The title of this post is verbose enough about the feelings I have regarding the naming of this library.

In this trip I had the opportunity of meeting many different interesting people from all walks of life. People with different life experiences that ranged from an ex-con to people who had successfully started their own tech company. Amongst all these people, there was one that really stood out for me, and that was [Pascal Finette](http:\/\/finette.com\/) who you might or not know. Pascal is *something* at Mozilla. To be frank, I didn\u2019t actually get what\u2019s his official position but in the grand scheme of things, it didn\u2019t really matter. As a matter of fact, I think that\u2019s part of the take home message from the presentation Pascal gave us. What you do matters much more than what you say.\n\nIn many ways, Pascal\u2019s talk was inspiring. Somehow I had this prejudice that Mozilla (and Firefox, more specifically) was a dying brand\/company, but this view changed as soon as I stepped into their offices in Silicon Valley and started hearing about their core values. Many a times we hear the cliche \u201cthere\u2019s no free lunch\u201d, but if there is such a thing as *free lunch*, then that\u2019s what Mozilla is doing for us and they\u2019re doing it for the sake of it. Truly for free. Looking at what Mozilla does from a truly objective perspective, it kinda feels like Mozilla is the Mother Theresa of the software world. And don\u2019t take me wrong, there are many such companies out there, but Mozilla in particular inspires me for how they defined their core values and for how they juggle so well their position as a company that needs to be kept financially afloat and as an ultimately open-source organization which relies (as far as I understand) solely on no one but themselves and a bunch of people who contribute with labor and money.\n\nI\u2019m an open-source advocate, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m an open-source monkey.

Through one talk by Pascal Finette.\n\n\n","html":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My blog writing continues being as sporadic as sporadic can be, and it kind of saddens me because writing still is very much a passion for me.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This time I come to you, my readers, with an exciting trip I recently took to Silicon Valley with a group of entrepreneurs from Delft&#8217;s University of Technology. In this trip I had the opportunity of meeting many different interesting people from all walks of life. People with different life experiences that ranged from an ex-con to people who had successfully started their own tech company. Amongst all these people, there was one that really stood out for me, and that was <a href=\"http:\/\/finette.com\/\">Pascal Finette<\/a> who you might or not know. Pascal is <em>something<\/em> at Mozilla. To be frank, I didn&#8217;t actually get what&#8217;s his official position but in the grand scheme of things, it didn&#8217;t really matter. As a matter of fact, I think that&#8217;s part of the take home message from the presentation Pascal gave us. What you do matters much more than what you say.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In many ways, Pascal&#8217;s talk was inspiring. Somehow I had this prejudice that Mozilla (and Firefox, more specifically) was a dying brand\/company, but this view changed as soon as I stepped into their offices in Silicon Valley and started hearing about their core values. Many a times we hear the cliche &#8220;there&#8217;s no free lunch&#8221;, but if there is such a thing as <em>free lunch<\/em>, then that&#8217;s what Mozilla is doing for us and they&#8217;re doing it for the sake of it. Truly for free. Looking at what Mozilla does from a truly objective perspective, it kinda feels like Mozilla is the Mother Theresa of the software world. And don&#8217;t take me wrong, there are many such companies out there, but Mozilla in particular inspires me for how they defined their core values and for how they juggle so well their position as a company that needs to be kept financially afloat and as an ultimately open-source organization which relies (as far as I understand) solely on no one but themselves and a bunch of people who contribute with labor and money.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I&#8217;m an open-source advocate, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m an open-source monkey. I&#8217;m that kind of guy who knows the value of open-source but not the kind of guy who uses open-source exclusively just because it&#8217;s open and free.

Their loosely coupled nature was gonna revolutionize the world and software developers all over the world were on the edge of their seats. The problem is, the promise was never delivered. Technologies were created to deploy web services but it seems that, because nobody actually knew what a web service was supposed to be rather than a *service on the web*, opinions and implementations greatly diverged. With effect, five years ago one could not talk about services without mentioning SOAP. SOAP was\u00a0**the** protocol to use when dealing with services, but it didn\u2019t take long for developers to realize that it was just a glorified, verbosely text-based CORBA. There is, however, a major difference. CORBA, widely criticized by some, actually made it big and it works just as RMI and DCOM do.\n\nSo what exactly is it that I can do with SOAP that I can\u2019t do with any of the other technologies? Does it actually give you an edge when developing composite applications out of web services?\u00a0*Not really.* And this is where it all failed.\n\nNot long after SOAP was released, developers realized: wait a minute. When I\u2019m browsing on the Internet, isn\u2019t my browser just exchanging messages with a remote server, which in turn exchanges messages with other backend components? Of course it is! So why do we need a whole new protocol for service communication when we already have HTTP which **works well** and\u00a0is probably more widely spread than any other technology? This is when REST came to life. Now, REST is a combination of two things: clever URL handling and JSON. JSON is a very succinct serialization technology for software objects and now that we had a way to encode messages, we needed a way to pass them along. Some really clever people decided that you could use the HTTP URL as a reference for which object you were referring to and the HTTP action (PUT, GET, DELETE, POST) as the operation you wanted to perform. The JSON message is attached to the HTTP\u2019s payload et voil\u00e0. That\u2019s all there is to REST.\n\nNow, web services must deal with something that never before had to be done. When I\u2019m in control of all my software, I have my dependencies as static libraries and I\u2019m in charge of when I want to evolve them (if ever). Software evolution, in the most common definition of the term, also implies some sort of software version. Maybe I\u2019m using a minor version upgrade which fixes bugs and no changes are required, maybe I\u2019m using a major version upgrade which radically changes that particular application\u2019s API. The take home message is: you\u00a0*need* the version to be able to know that the software you downloaded\u00a0*just now*\u00a0contains security fix X and is different from the one you downloaded 5 seconds ago. Without this concept of versioning, you\u2019re down to comparing file hashes and may God help us all.*  \n*\n\nHowever, this concept of versioning seems to hurt the very nature of web services. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m developing an application and I need an external provider to provide me with information regarding the price that I, as a company myself, can get for renting a hotel room to a 3rd party. When I\u2019m linking my system to this external provider, I don\u2019t necessarily want to know that I\u2019m using version 2.3.1 of their RoomBookingService. What my software needs is a value and what *I* as a software developer need is a way to tell my program how to obtain it. If my service provided decides to update to version 2.3.2 to roll in a bugfix, I don\u2019t want to have to change anything unless the value my software requires is specifically targeted.\n\nSo what am I saying exactly?\n\nWell, maybe it\u2019s not so obvious so far, but I\u2019m saying death to software versions!\n\n**WAIT! Before you move on to the comments section and start bashing me, read on.**\n\nWe most definitely will always need software versions. Internally, my service provider needs a way of knowing what the heck they are working with, but even then perhaps a revision number would be much more suitable than the traditional major.minor.build approach. The point is, when I\u2019m using software that\u00a0*I don\u2019t control*, I\u2019m not actually using software. Not from the consumer\u2019s point of view. What I am doing is polling a source of data and hoping that I get the expected result.\n\nDoes the provider want to change the internal algorithm and make the whole process faster? By all means! As long as you can guarantee (*and you should, otherwise you\u2019re not testing enough)* that the output hasn\u2019t changed, I will be more than happy about this improvement. Has the output changed? Well then, alert me. What are the changes? Was the output buggy before? Well then,\u00a0**do** alert me! Because my business logic is probably wrongly composed to deal with buggy data! Are you gonna make extensive refactoring changes? Do you absolutely\u00a0*have to*? Is there any way you can still put out the data in the old format despite all your inner changes? If you really have to, then **alert**\u00a0**everyone** who uses that service, let them know **when** you plan on doing it,\u00a0**show them what changes are coming**\u00a0and go ahead.\n\nThat\u2019s service evolution. Don\u2019t mess around with versions. Instead, focus on what your consumers want and that is only one thing: data.\n\nNow, the future I see for web services is actually the future that was initially envisioned. The future where **everything** is provided as a service. Need a libxml? Plug your app to http:\/\/xmlutils.com\/libxml. Need to create a PDF out of a DOCX? Head out to http:\/\/pdfutils.com\/pdfcreator. This is how services\u00a0*would* be convenient. Whether the technology is ready for such a thing, that\u2019s a whole different story. History has also taught us that whenever something would be convenient, technology follows suit very shortly. While I\u2019m still a skeptical about the usefulness of services in their original format, I do think there is hope. We\u2019re just not there yet (and probably won\u2019t be for a long time).\n\nIf you ask me what\u2019s a service by nowadays definition? It\u2019s nothing more than a glorified, technology-agnostic, web-based API, of which the client does not control when to migrate to new versions.\n\n\n","html":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When web services were envisioned more than 10 years ago, they were promoted as the panacea for software pains.

While much of the Western world does not know about [WeChat](http:\/\/www.wechat.com\/), surely everyone has at some point or another heard of WhatsApp or Blackberry Messenger. Well, WeChat is very much the same thing but it\u2019s the most popular mobile instant messaging chat in China with over **300 million users**! The single one feature that makes WeChat unique is having a walkie-talkie feature in its very core. At the literal push and release of a single button, WeChat users can send voice messages to each other, thus avoiding all the trouble of typing.\n\nBecause WeChat is popular in China, it is bound to push notifications which include Chinese characters. These characters are currently not supported in the Pebble (it uses Unicode for character encoding but due to space restriction it does not include fonts for characters beyond the Latin alphabet) and WeChat Pebble also takes this issue out of the way.\n\nAdding a font with 2000~3000 characters seems to be troublesome due to severe space restrictions in the Pebble firmware. Therefore, I came up with an approach which makes use of the [Unifont character library](http:\/\/unifoundry.com\/unifont.html) to render messages on the Android app and send them to the Pebble watch as a bitmap.

While much of the Western world does not know about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wechat.com\/\">WeChat<\/a>, surely everyone has at some point or another heard of WhatsApp or Blackberry Messenger. Well, WeChat is very much the same thing but it&#8217;s the most popular mobile instant messaging chat in China with over <strong>300 million users<\/strong>! The single one feature that makes WeChat unique is having a walkie-talkie feature in its very core. At the literal push and release of a single button, WeChat users can send voice messages to each other, thus avoiding all the trouble of typing.<\/p>\n<p>Because WeChat is popular in China, it is bound to push notifications which include Chinese characters. These characters are currently not supported in the Pebble (it uses Unicode for character encoding but due to space restriction it does not include fonts for characters beyond the Latin alphabet) and WeChat Pebble also takes this issue out of the way.<\/p>\n<p>Adding a font with 2000~3000 characters seems to be troublesome due to severe space restrictions in the Pebble firmware. Therefore, I came up with an approach which makes use of the <a href=\"http:\/\/unifoundry.com\/unifont.html\">Unifont character library<\/a> to render messages on the Android app and send them to the Pebble watch as a bitmap. This effectively solves the problem not only for Chinese but also for Russian, Hebrew, you name it!<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_600\" style=\"width: 287px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-07-31-13.57.36.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-600  \" alt=\"WeChat Pebble in action!\" src=\"http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/2013-07-31-13.57.36.jpg\" width=\"277\" height=\"368\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">WeChat Pebble in action!<\/p><\/div>\n<p>All of this is available as open-source and for free.<\/p>\n<p>-&gt; <strong>If you are a developer<\/strong>, read past the installation steps for some hardcore open-source goodies<\/p>\n<p>-&gt; <strong>If you just want to use this<\/strong> and don&#8217;t care about the source code, just read the following two simple steps!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 16px;\">1 &#8211; Install the Android app available in the Play Store\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.espinhasoftware.wechatpebble\">here<\/a>\u00a0or by scanning the QR code below.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:\u00a0<\/strong>For the app to actually push the WeChat notifications you have to first start the app and follow the instructions.

But alas, this is my personal blog, and for all I care, kefir grains are actually nanobots which use milk as fuel and drop yoghurt from their behinds (yes, I have a fertile imagination). But no. Kefir grains are really just very much organic yeasts and bacteria which help each other survive and which do, in fact, feed on the fats and nutrients of milk.\n\nNow! You just got some kefir from me (or from anyone else). Now what? What are you supposed to do with this? How can you get kefir milk?\n\nFret not! Even though I still hold [Dom\u2019s website](http:\/\/users.sa.chariot.net.au\/~dna\/kefirpage.html) as my reference and all my knowledge comes from there, I realize it can be somewhat daunting to go over endless paragraphs of narrative just to learn how to grow kefir. This is why I decided to compile this abridged version that can get you started in no time.\n\n### Jump here if you\u2019re an impatient reader\n\n1. Okay, first thing you should know: kefir grains will **die** unless taken care of. Like I said, kefir grains are living bacteria and yeasts and to be kept alive, they should be **in milk at all times**.\n2. The very second thing you should know is that both kefir grains and the kefir milk itself **should not come in contact with reactive metals**. Reactive metals are for example copper and aluminum and probably others which I can\u2019t think of right now. This means that whatever utensil you use with kefir should be **plastic** or, ultimately, **if you really have to**, *stainless steel* is also tolerable. There\u2019s a very strong reason for this and there\u2019s actually a **health danger** that comes with using reactive metals. Especially if you\u2019re keeping your kefir in metal bottles, because kefir is an acidic solution (kefir milk has a pH of approximately 4.5) it will react with the metal and you can actually get\u00a0**very ill in the long term** from metal poisoning. **SO!** Use plastic utensils and keep your kefir in glass containers (plastic also works, but I prefer glass). Like I said, stainless steel has very little reactivity (is this even a word?!) and for some time I was using a stainless steel strainer without a problem, but I seriously recommend nylon or plastic.\n3. The third thing about kefir has to do with temperature. To make kefir you\u2019re gonna place your kefir grains in fresh milk (UHT milk **does not work very well**) and leave it at **room temperature**. Now, of course, room temperature is a very arbitrary concept. Room temperature means 24 degrees for me but maybe your house is colder or warmer. Worry not! Kefir can stand a very wide range of temperatures, anything from 20 to 28 degrees will keep your grains happy, keeping in mind that they can also go in the fridge (but this is something that should not be done often). Now, you\u2019re probably thinking about whether or not it is dangerous to leave *fresh milk* at room temperature and the answer is NO! Normally milk would go bad at room temperature in no time, but because you have your kefir grains inside, the good bacteria from kefir give the bad bacteria (that would make the milk go bad) no chance to spread. So yes, keeping the milk at room temperature is **the normal way of making****kefir***.*\n4. The fourth thing you should know is that making kefir milk does come with some work involved. For instance, it takes kefir grains approximately 24 hours to convert an appropriately sized portion of milk into kefir milk. This means that **every 24 hours** you\u2019ll be straining your kefir milk and placing the strained grains in fresh milk. As you can imagine, unless you really like kefir, you\u2019re gonna get tired after doing this every 24 hours. Still, again, worry not! Even if you\u2019re not an avid kefir milk drinker, there\u2019s *a way out*. Like I said before, keeping the kefir grains in milk at room temperature is *the normal way* of making kefir. Still, you can also keep the milk with the grains in the fridge. At fridge temperature, it will take the grains **a week** before they ferment the milk into kefir milk. While this sounds like the perfect solution, **do keep in mind** that every once in a while you should do 2 or 3 batches of kefir at room temperature. The reason behind this is that by making kefir milk in the fridge, you\u2019re exposing the kefir grains to temperatures they\u2019re not very comfortable with. Therefore, make sure you don\u2019t let your grains die and if you\u2019re using the fridge approach, let them out at room temperature every now and then.\n5. The fifth thing has to do with fermentation times. Keep in mind the following **blanket rule**: **kefir is drinkable at any fermentation stage**. This means that if you forgot your kefir and left it fermenting too long, you **don\u2019t have to throw it away**. It\u2019s still good although you will notice the flavor will become somewhat sourish. At some points you may also feel the aroma of fresh yeast, **which is perfectly normal**. Normally if you have more or less the right amount of grains per quantity of milk, it will take the grains around 24 hours to turn the milk into kefir milk. Still, sometimes we have too many grains and it will take a little shorter to accomplish the same. That\u2019s perfectly fine and the best way of knowing whether kefir is ready is to just look at it and shake the jar a little bit! If it looks creamy or already solid, your kefir is probably ready. It\u2019s also perfectly fine (and I recommend it) to stir the kefir milk around half way through (~12h mark) the process. This will make sure the grains circulate around the milk and get in contact with fresh milk that\u2019s not yet kefir.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it! These five items are the major things you should know about kefir. There\u2019s **one last thing** I would like to mention and that is the type of milk that you use. I **strongly recommend** that you use non-skim milk (in het Nederlands: volle melk). In my experience, the skimmed milk is just not as creamy and the results are not as good as full fat milk. My grains (in case you got your kefir from me) are also **ALWAYS** fermented in biologic full fat fresh milk from Campina. The biologic thing is not a requirement but I like to think the kefir grains are happier in milk made by happier cows!\n\nThat\u2019s it for this post! If you do have any questions, feel free to message me on Facebook, drop me a comment or just e-mail me! Whatever works for you!\n\n\n","html":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My last post introduced the wonders of kefir and the magic grains that ferment milk into delish yoghurt.

This is also something mentioned by Maleshkova et al in their work on \u201c*Investigating Web APIs on the World Wide Web*\u201d ([pre-print](http:\/\/sweet-dev.open.ac.uk\/war\/Papers\/mmaWebAPISurvey.pdf), I[EEE citable](http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpls\/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5693251&tag=1)). The authors claim that *\u201ctwo thirds of the APIs do not state the data-type of the input and 40% of the APIs do not state the HTTP method. If a standard interface description language, such as WSDL, [was] used [\u2026] this would be unthinkable\u201d*.\n\nThis is very true. Read on to know more.\n\nWhile SOAP services are always backed up by their WSDL files which describe the interfaces, including all the methods and data types, the much more popular REST services have no such feature. Instead, developers are left with manually created web pages which describe in natural language how to invoke the web API and what the endpoints are; case in point: [Facebook](https:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/docs\/reference\/api\/publishing\/), [Twitter](https:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/docs\/api\/1.1) and [Netflix](http:\/\/developer.netflix.com\/docs\/HTTP_Status_Codes). But what about when web API developers forget to change the documentation, or even worse, make a mistake when specifying the interface? This is when having automatic recovery of the REST interface would prove useful.\n\nThe possibilities are endless. This recovery can be done on either client or server side (or both) and each of the sides can add a different view and understanding of the communication. Where with a SOAP-generated WSDL file we know that** whatever is in the WSDL file is what\u2019s available in the system, *no more, no less,* by doing recovery of a REST interface we can learn many things:\n\n1. Client-side recovered interface: whatever is in the recovered interface *may or may not* be all that\u2019s available on the server-side.

This is also something mentioned by Maleshkova et al in their work on &#8220;<em>Investigating Web APIs on the World Wide Web<\/em>&#8221; (<a href=\"http:\/\/sweet-dev.open.ac.uk\/war\/Papers\/mmaWebAPISurvey.pdf\">pre-print<\/a>, I<a href=\"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpls\/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5693251&amp;tag=1\">EEE citable<\/a>). The authors claim that <em>&#8220;two thirds of the APIs do not state the data-type of the input and 40% of the APIs do not state the HTTP method. If a standard interface description language, such as WSDL, [was] used [&#8230;] this would be unthinkable&#8221;<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is very true. Read on to know more.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While SOAP services are always backed up by their WSDL files which describe the interfaces, including all the methods and data types, the much more popular REST services have no such feature. Instead, developers are left with manually created web pages which describe in natural language how to invoke the web API and what the endpoints are; case in point: <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/docs\/reference\/api\/publishing\/\">Facebook<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/docs\/api\/1.1\">Twitter<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/developer.netflix.com\/docs\/HTTP_Status_Codes\">Netflix<\/a>. But what about when web API developers forget to change the documentation, or even worse, make a mistake when specifying the interface? This is when having automatic recovery of the REST interface would prove useful.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The possibilities are endless. This recovery can be done on either client or server side (or both) and each of the sides can add a different view and understanding of the communication. Where with a SOAP-generated WSDL file we know that<em><\/em> whatever is in the WSDL file is what&#8217;s available in the system, <em>no more, no less,<\/em> by doing recovery of a REST interface we can learn many things:<\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Client-side recovered interface: whatever is in the recovered interface <em>may or may not<\/em> be all that&#8217;s available on the server-side.

While pure random is what you\u2019d ideally want (and software generated random is, to the best of my knowledge, simply pseudo-random but that\u2019s another discussion), when you\u2019re using it in a board game and your luck depends on the most rolled combinations, I say you really don\u2019t want pure random.\n\nStatistically speaking, you **could** roll two dies 100 times and get 100 times 1+1\u2026 It\u2019s an extremely unlikely event but the probability does exist since each throw is independent. This means that if I picked number 8 and this event happens, what was a seemingly smart choice (8 and 6 are the numbers which, after 7, have the highest probability of being rolled with 2d6) is all of a sudden a dumb choice because we happened to stumble upon the 0.(insert-many-zeros)1% chance that rolling 1+1 happens 100 times in a row.\n\nThis happens because our random generator does generate (a kind of) randomness which eventually would converge to the Gaussian curve. However, because it\u2019s random, there\u2019s no guarantee of how many throws it will take for this to happen. Then my theory was that for board games it would be wise to correct for normalization within the average number of rolls that this particular board game takes. Statistics tells us that **eventually**, with two perfectly balanced dice and with a sufficiently large number of throws, you\u2019d fall back to the Gaussian curve, however, in a game that takes, say, 300 throws, the curve may be far from following the expected probabilities within the number of throws you\u2019ll do for this game.\n\nWhat should we do then? The solution seems obvious to me. When playing board games, you need a number generator which is not random but rather one that compensates the probabilities based on previous throws. Yes, now is the time you can go up in arms and say that this is not random and it is not non-deterministic because well, you\u2019re right! This compensation would be done based off a certain number of throws which is the average number of throws which that particular board game takes. Threw 299 throws, number 8 came 100 times but number 6 was only rolled 99 times?

They\u2019re cheap and according to the RPi peripherals list [[here](http:\/\/elinux.org\/RPi_USB_Wi-Fi_Adapters)], are supposed to work well under Linux. They do, however, require a special driver which is not included in the Linux kernel itself. This leaves you with two options:\n\n\u2013 Use one of MrEngman\u2019s pre-compiled kernel modules which is available on the Raspberry Pi forums [[here](http:\/\/www.raspberrypi.org\/forums\/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=62371)] (kudos to MrEngman to his ongoing effort!).\n\nor\n\n\u2013 You compile your own kernel module.\n\nHowever, keep in mind the following\u00a0**very important caveat**: whatever your choice is, this process requires some basic knowledge of Linux! If you don\u2019t feel comfortable messing around with kernel modules and such, I would recommend that you proceed with caution and maybe even ask a more experienced friend to give you a hand. It\u2019s unlikely you will ruin your Raspberry Pi but you may very well ruin your installation.\u00a0**PROCEED WITH CAUTION.**\n\nNow, be aware that if you just want your wifi up and running and don\u2019t want to be bothered, you really should take the easy way out here and check whether MrEngman has a pre-compiled module that\u2019s been compiled with the same revision of your kernel. If you cannot find one or if you\u2019re feeling especially brave, read on for the step by step on how to compile it yourself.\n\nAlso keep in mind that this tutorial applies to the Raspbian distribution. It may (or may not) work in Pidora (and others) but it\u2019s up to you to adjust accordingly.\n\n\n# Compiling a kernel module\n\nBe wary, this assumes you\u2019re going to compile a kernel module to the latest version of the Raspberry Pi firmware (and thus, at the time of writing, for the latest version of the 3.10.y branch). If you\u2019re not running this version, consider updating [[updating the RPi to the latest firmware](https:\/\/github.com\/Hexxeh\/rpi-update)]!\n\n\n## Pre-requisites\n\n- Linux kernel source for the Raspberry Pi (do\u00a0**NOT** use the original Linux kernel as it does not contain all the patches and drivers required for your RPi to work smoothly), available on GitHub [[here](https:\/\/github.com\/raspberrypi\/linux\/tree\/rpi-3.10.y)].\n- Driver for the RTL8188EU, available on GitHub [[here](https:\/\/github.com\/lwfinger\/rtl8188eu)].\n\nMany Linux distributions provide a package just with the precompiled kernel headers and that makes it easier than what you\u2019ll have to do on the Raspberry Pi. Still, it\u2019s not so difficult. All you have to do is:\n\n### Cloning and compiling the Linux kernel\n\n1. Start by cloning the Linux kernel for the RPi\n\ncd \/usr\/src\/ sudo git clone https:\/\/github.com\/raspberrypi\/linux.git rpi-3.10.y cd \/usr\/src\/rpi-3.10.y\/\n\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">This will have created a folder called \/usr\/src\/rpi-3.10.y\/ where all the Linux kernel source now resides in your Raspberry Pi.<\/span>\n\n2. For ease of use, create a symbolic link to the \/lib\/modules\/ structure\n\nsudo ln -s \/usr\/src\/rpi-3.10.y \/lib\/modules\/`uname -r`\/build\n\nBe sure to write it in as is (or simply copy & paste it in!) as the backticks around uname -r will create the right name for the folder. At this point, your \/lib\/modules\/ path will have a link to the directory where the source code resides. We do this so later when we compile the driver, our life becomes much easier (as the Makefile will automatically look in that directory).\n\n3. Copy your kernel configuration file to the directory where the source is:\n\nsudo sh -c 'zcat \/proc\/config.gz > .config'\n\nThis simply pulls the config from your running kernel into the new kernel you\u2019re about to compile.\n\n4. Pull the latest Module.symvers into your kernel\u2019s directory. Note: this is one of the reasons why I would recommend updating first to the latest kernel, otherwise you\u2019ll have to figure out which Module.symvers you need.\n\ncurl -O\u00a0https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/raspberrypi\/firmware\/master\/extra\/Module.symvers\n\n5. Compile the kernel to a stage that is ready to be linked against kernel modules. You don\u2019t want to compile the whole kernel since that\u2019s 1) not necessary for compiling kernel modules and 2) would take ages on a Raspberry Pi with its limited computing power.\n\nsudo make oldconfig sudo make modules_prepare\n\n6. Clone the driver off GitHub, compile it and off you go!\n\ncd \/usr\/src\/ git clone\u00a0https:\/\/github.com\/lwfinger\/rtl8188eu.git cd \/usr\/src\/rtl8188eu\/ sudo make sudo make install\n\nAt this stage, the driver\u2019s firmware as well as the compiled kernel module have been copied into place but there are a few more considerations to be had.\n\n1 \u2013 Do\u00a0**NOT** plug the wifi dongle with the Raspberry Pi turned on! Many people (including me) have reported that doing so causes the Raspberry Pi to suddenly restart and this can lead to serious corruption of your SD card. Be on the safe side! Shut down your Raspberry Pi (sudo shutdown -h now), plug in the dongle, and turn it back on.\n\n2 \u2013 At this point, when you run \u201cifconfig\u201d you should already have a wlan0 network which is not connected to anything. In my experience, getting it to connect was the biggest challenge so if you have a WPA\/WPA2 network and would like to learn how to connect to it via command line, read on.\n\n\n# Connecting to a WPA\/WPA2 network via command line\n\nWhen you know what you\u2019re doing, this is an extremely simple process. First off, run the following command:\n\nwpa_passphrase <ssid>\n\nWhere you should replace <ssid> with the actual SSID of your network (hint: use \u201c\u201d if your network\u2019s name has spaces in it). It will then prompt you to type in the password for your network. This script generates then a few lines in the format of:\n\nnetwork={ \u00a0 \u00a0 ssid=\"Foo\" \u00a0 \u00a0 #psk=\"FoobarFoobar\" \u00a0 \u00a0 psk=f21df897e40a0e7253b8d53e35930e814f312df43ca2b085daa5109f2c2c5e54 }\n\nI recommend that you delete the line started by #psk (as it reveals your password in clear text) and the rest you should copy and paste into a file at \/etc\/wpa_supplicant.conf. If it exists, overwrite it, if it does not exist, then create it (with e.g. sudo nano \/etc\/wpa_supplicant.conf).\n\nAfter you\u2019ve done that, you need to tell Linux how this network is going to get an IP address and how it\u2019s managed. You can do so by editing the \/etc\/network\/interfaces file as such:\n\nsudo nano \/etc\/network\/interfaces\n\nHere you should lookout for a line that starts as \u201ciface wlan0\u201d. In my case, this line was setting wlan0 as manual which is\u00a0**NOT** what we want. Ultimately you want something that looks like this:\n\niface wlan0 inet dhcp wpa-conf \/etc\/wpa_supplicant.conf\n\nAnd\u00a0**watch out!** If there is a line starting with \u201cwpa-roam\u201d, you can safely delete it as it will conflict with your new WPA settings!\n\nAfter you\u2019ve modified the file you can then save it and we\u2019re ready for action. Next thing you need to do is take the WLAN interface down and back up as such:\n\nsudo ifdown wlan0 sudo ifup wlan0\n\nAnd that\u2019s it! If everything went well, your Raspberry Pi should now be connected to your network via wifi!\n\nIf there\u2019s something that\u2019s not clear enough or some steps that I missed, feel free to drop me an e-mail. My e-mail address is my first name [@] my last name [dot] nl. And you can find my first and last name in the url of this blog (hint, my first name is Tiago!).\n\nFinally I would like to thank MrEngman for his dedication and continuous engagement in the Raspberry Pi forums as well as lwfinger for maintaining this driver and making it possible for us to use it on Linux! I would also like to thank Martijn from Grendelman.net for this [blog post](http:\/\/www.grendelman.net\/wp\/compiling-kernel-modules-for-raspbian-raspberry-pi\/) which helped me in getting all this to work. Thanks! In a future post I will come back and explain how to cross-compile a kernel module for the Raspberry Pi so you can get it done faster by using your (more powerful) desktop computer to do the compilation.\n\n\n","html":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Recently I bought two\u00a0TP-Link TL-WN725N adapters off Amazon.

However, if you have the time and feel like reading some of my ramblings, why don\u2019t you just continue with the next paragraph? I promise you won\u2019t be disappointed!\n\n### My beginning as an urban farmer\n\nSpring is here and with it comes the sunshine, even in [rainy Netherlands](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Netherlands#Climate). For this reason I recently started growing all kinds of things at home. First I started with some of those tiny thumb-sized vases which come bundled with sunflower and lavender seeds but\u2026 soon after, I realized those vases were not gonna be big enough to hold that many seeds. Determined to see those plants through to flowering, I started buying bigger vases and soil. Soon after that, I was growing not only the sunflowers and lavender but I sowed some seeds I had bought a long time ago. I was now growing several shoots of *[mimosa pudica](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mimosa_pudica) (aka the shy plant, famous for the fact that it closes its leaves when you poke it \u2013 which you can see [on Youtube](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BLTcVNyOhUc))*, a few more seedlings of *[chinese chives](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Allium_tuberosum) (or scientifically speaking, allium tuberosum**, delicious in many dishes)* and my proudest plantation, seedlings of the hottest pepper in the world: the *[trinidad moruga scorpion](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trinidad_moruga_scorpion), which i*n the the [Scoville scale](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scoville_scale) is said to be approximately 500 times hotter than your average Jalape\u00f1o or Chipotle chilli. Now THAT\u2019S spicy!\n\nYou like the post so far? Well keep on reading then!\n\n### Okay, I became\u00a0a farmer.\n\nYeah okay, I didn\u2019t start farming because the weather was nice. Most people who face the same circumstances will just go to the beach or do a barbecue or just have a beer with friends in the sunshine but\u2026 I realized I like farming. In a more and more brick and mortar world where everywhere there\u2019s buildings and cars and in a world where more and more the artificial replaces the natural, it is nice to have a small piece of nature close by.\n\nAt this point I had a substantial collection of vases and it didn\u2019t take me long to\u00a0realize that\u00a0I sometimes would forget my plants and the soil would be bone dry. Whilst plants make for great landscape, they are very unobtrusive and don\u2019t exactly ask for water the same way my cat used to. So I decided to put my skills to good use and do something about it. After some browsing on eBay I found the perfect tool for the task: soil moisture sensors. It is important that you realize that these sensors are nothing but metal plates with a silicon coating so don\u2019t expect anything too fancy and always remember the adage: you get what you pay for.\n\nThe sensors themselves are pretty useless but I had a few Raspberry Pi boards laying around so\u00a0I started investigating whether it would be possible to take analog readouts with it, which, to my dismay, was not possible. At least not without using a USB soundcard (it\u2019s pretty ingenious actually\u2026 when you think of it, what\u2019s sound if not analog current waves at different frequencies?). So I decided to be more professional and bought an old friend of mine: an Arduino Nano board which can take all kinds of readouts. It does have however the inconvenient of not being able to push the readouts anywhere. You can\u2019t connect it to a network which means you can\u2019t exactly take the data out into a database and plot it without additional devices and so the Raspberry Pi came to rescue!\n\n### Time to join the forces of my inner farmer and inner nerd together!\n\nWhat was my goal then? I wanted to build a setup that would allow me to plot a nice graph with a live readout from my plants\u2019 soil humidity. Two problems there: to plot a graph you\u2019ll need to store the data somewhere and\u2026 with the cheap soil moisture sensors I had bought, \u201clive\u201d was not going to be possible.\u00a0**This is something I cannot stress enough: if you\u2019ll use the same sensors as me, do NOT leave them powered for longer than what is needed to take the readout.**\u00a0Below in this post\u00a0I explain why.\n\nSo in the end, I setup the following\u00a0(photo below):\n\n\u2013 Raspberry Pi, connected to my home network (the red UTP cable).\n\n\u2013 Arduino, plugged to the soil moisture sensors and connected via USB to the Raspberry Pi.\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_694\" style=\"width: 522px\">[![Raspberry Pi + Arduino wired together](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/2014-05-09-12.13.19.jpg)](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/2014-05-09-12.13.19.jpg)Raspberry Pi + Arduino wired together\n\n<\/div>Then with some of my rusty C code I was able to get the Arduino up and running and sending data back to the Raspberry Pi.\n\nAt this point please understand that there are a **multitude of ways** in which the\u00a0**exact same thing can be achieved**. This is just what I came up with after experimenting with a couple of ways.\n\nIn essence, what I have is: three DuPont cables going from separate digital pins on the RPi which in turn connect to separate digital pins on the Arduino Nano. The Arduino Nano has one digital pin per soil moisture sensor (which is plugged to the VCC in each of the small devices on the right\u2026 they are YL-38 sensors and are explained later) and one analog pin also per soil moisture sensor (plugged to the A0 in the same YL-38 devices, to take the soil moisture readings).\n\nThe idea is that periodically the Raspberry Pi will send a signal to the Arduino on a specific digital pin which will then cause the Arduino board to power the small bridge device which in turn outputs an analog readout (essentially an AC wave) which the Arduino listens on and prints to the serial console.\n\n**FRIENDLY ADVICE:\u00a0**After reading around, I learned it is best to do\u00a0this for short periods of time \u2013 namely, not for longer than just a few seconds. If you keep the bridge device powered at all times, your sensor probes will rust within the hour due to the\u00a0electrolysis which the DC current will cause to the plates. After that happens, your sensor is pretty much garbage\u00a0as the sensor probes will have corroded and the\u00a0moisture readouts will have become inaccurate.\n\nAlso of note is how the readings might fluctuate just after you powered the sensor. For this reason it is wise to take a series of readings (I take 20) and discard the first few (I discard the first half). Then you might as well just store a burst of readings which you can later plot into a graph.\n\n### What do you need exactly?\n\nMy goal is to merely give you the idea and the very general pointers of how to get around doing something like this. It\u2019s most definitely not difficult and anyone with a basic understanding of electronics can get it up and running in a matter of hours. This was a lot of fun for me to figure out myself\u00a0and for this reason I will not publish the code but merely give you, the reader, a general idea of what has to be done. With this and some programming knowledge, you should be able get this up and running in no time. Here\u2019s a very general walkthrough:\n\n- Get both a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino board. It doesn\u2019t matter which Arduino. There\u2019s many different types and I\u2019ve chosen the Nano variant because it strikes a great\u00a0balance between functionality and form-factor.\n- You\u2019ll also need a breadboard and DuPont wires. You can get these cheaply off eBay and I found that for most of these usages, male to female cables are ideal (the male end goes into the breadboard whereas the female end can plug directly into sensors\u2019 pins).\n- Obviously you\u2019ll also need soil moisture sensors (photo below). There\u2019s a lot of variety here both in quality and price range. To get started I suggest you look for the cheap kind on eBay where you can get a Chinese-built YL-69 (although I normally just search for \u2018soil moisture sensor\u2019) for a little over 2 euro. These sensors also come with a \u2018middle-man\u2019 circuit which allows you to get two outputs: one is an analog readout of the resistance between the sensor\u2019s two plates and the second is a digital output (essentially, HIGH or LOW, 5v or 0v) depending on whether the humidity is above or below a threshold which can in turn be adjusted by a built-in POTS. Personally I just take the analog readout and ignore the digital one. This allows me to make pretty graphs like you can see later in this post.\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_701\" style=\"width: 522px\">[![Above, the soil moisture sensor itself (YL-69). Below, the bridge device which you'll need to use (YL-38).](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/2014-05-09-12.51.20.jpg)](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/2014-05-09-12.51.20.jpg)Above, the soil moisture sensor itself (YL-69). Below, the bridge device which you\u2019ll need to use (YL-38).\n\n<\/div>After you have all the materials, it\u2019s very simple to get started. The **YL-69** sensor itself has two pins which need to be wired to the two pins on the **YL-38** bridge (specifically, the two isolated pins). On the other end of the YL-38, you have four pins which (top to bottom) represent VCC, GND, D0 and A0. VCC and GND are your power pins which should be set to 3.3\/5V and Ground (respectively) and your A0 is an analog output which you will connect to an analog input on the Arduino board (the Arduino Nano has 8 analog pins) via the breadboard.\n\n**FRIENDLY REMINDER: **DO NOT keep the YL-38 bridge powered for long periods of time. If you leave it permanently on, it will keep applying DC current to the YL-69 sensor which will cause corrosion due to electrolysis. If you want to keep your sensors in good shape for as long as possible, you will only apply power to VCC before you make a reading. Additionally, be sure to at least every week switch the two cables going to the YL-69 sensor as to slow down corrosion as much as possible.\n\nThis being said, you\u2019ll want to plug the VCC on the YL-38 bridge to a digital pin on the Arduino board which you will set to HIGH (thus effectively powering the bridge) before making a reading.\n\nWhen you have the Arduino and the sensors all hooked up, you\u2019ll want to get this plugged to your laptop so you can start experimenting with the code. If you need further help with this part, please drop me a comment or an e-mail (tiagoRemove-me-and-add-at-or-elseEspinha.nl)!\n\nAfter that\u2019s done, all you have to do is use one of the GPIO pins in the Raspberry Pi as a signal for the Arduino to start a reading. Essentially my (Python)\u00a0script does the following\u00a0goes something like:\n\n- This script first sets a GPIO pin to HIGH.\n- The Arduino is continuously listening to this pin and once it is raised to HIGH, sets the sensor\u2019s VCC to HIGH.\n- The Arduino continuously prints readouts from the sensor to the serial console.\n- The Python script is reading the USB output (i.e. the serial console) of the Arduino board and storing the readouts.\n- The Python script sends the readouts to my webserver where they are stored in a database.\n\nObviously, for this to work you\u2019ll need the Python libraries for the Raspberry Pi GPIO and I recommend the Python library for dealing with serial devices.\n\nAfter all\u2019s said and done, I can generate a graph such as this:\n\n### [![Screenshot 2014-05-13 20.35.53](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/Screenshot-2014-05-13-20.35.53.png)](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/Screenshot-2014-05-13-20.35.53.png)But wait, there\u2019s more!\n\nI\u2019m also the proud owner of a Pebble watch, so why not put this to good use, I thought! Everything was already in place so all I had to do was set up an alert system that monitors the last collected data. If it\u2019s above a \u201cdrought threshold\u201d, I receive an alert on my Pebble. But there\u2019s still more! As soon as I water my plants, I get another alert as seen below:\n\n\n# [![2014-04-28 08.41.21](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/2014-04-28-08.41.21.jpg)](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/2014-04-28-08.41.21.jpg)\n\n\u00a0\n\n### To conclude\n\nThanks for reading all the way here! I hope my post was of some help for you to start in a similar endeavor. I tried to keep the technicalities (scripts, etc) down to a minimum because, well, that was the most fun part of it and I wouldn\u2019t want to spoil any of it for you!

For many years, having a telescope has been a dream of mine but alas\u2026 they aren\u2019t exactly cheap instruments and I always had the feeling it would be something that would get old pretty fast.\n\nHowever, as soon as I had the chance to point the telescope at the tiny shiny blimp in the sky which turned out to be Saturn, and as soon as I was able to see its rings hanging around its spherical mass of gas, I was in love. \u201cWait, let\u2019s point it at the moon!\u201d \u2013 and I was even more in love. Somehow there is some astronomic quality and reality to seeing things through that glorified mirror-lined tube that photos simply cannot capture. Much the same way a single photograph cannot capture the greatness of the Great Wall, much the same way photos cannot describe the feeling of a plane banking to 30 degrees inclination to pull you out of the floor, out to 39000 feet to take you places\u2026 astronomic photographs, as spectacular and colorful as they may be, cannot describe the feeling of DIY pointing the telescope and sitting there looking, wondering, imagining.\n\nThis means, of course, one thing: for the next few months I will be badgering my wife, trying to persuade\u00a0her to allow me to invest in a good telescope.\n\nPart of this persuasion started last night when the ISS was flying past us at its incredible speed. Normally the ISS would only be visible in the wee hours of the night and we would have to wait for the right day where all the conditions were met. You need a clear sky, the station to be passing around your area and patience to wake up in the middle of the night to see it. But last night at 23:13 would be a perfect time to spot it. Our plan was almost foiled by the patchy clouds which were planning to ruin the fun but a couple of minutes past the announced time, there it was, in all its glory. A small patch of reflected light, in total size bigger than any star, bigger indeed than any planet \u00a0and about as big as one of the planes which usually make for the Rotterdam\/The Hague airport around the same area. But this one was different. It was not blinking but rather reflecting light, constantly so, and flying at a different bearing than of the planes. Hiding here and there behind one of the clouds, it was as visible as it could be in the sky which at that time was not yet so dark. In effect, as I recall, the sky\u2019s light night blue was probably the best to spot the station. Too dark and the station\u2019s colors would get lost in the background, too light and it is simply not visible at all, overexposed by the sunlight. It\u2019s pretty tough to find a photo of what we saw last night, mostly because spotting the ISS with the naked eye requires conditions which are very adverse to photography (darkness + fast moving objects) so here\u2019s a photo of the ISS in all its glory (photo courtesy of Wikipedia):\n\n[![International_Space_Station_after_undocking_of_STS-132](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/International_Space_Station_after_undocking_of_STS-132.jpg)](http:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/International_Space_Station_after_undocking_of_STS-132.jpg)\n\nThis was it, this was yet another step towards my space exploration. Yet another step in convincing my wife the 300 euro I need for a telescope will be worth it.\n\nOh yeah, my post\u2019s title was about how to see the ISS, right?

Now while the Dutch skies are not the best for astronomy due to having <a href=\"http:\/\/uk.arxiv.org\/pdf\/astro-ph\/0108052\"><em>the<\/em>\u00a0worst<\/a> light pollution\u00a0in Europe (probably due to its extensive greenhouses and the artificial lightning they require), it&#8217;s still possible to see the closer objects to Earth such as the planets in our own solar system.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[Continue reading, photos below]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While I had seen Jupiter in multiple occasions before, as it is visible with the naked eye, seeing its four largest moons live (Europa, Io, Ganymede and Callisto) was definitely a first for me. Believe me when I say that the photograph does not do justice to the real thing and it is indeed a pity. The photo has been taken last Sunday morning (October 5th 2014 at 6:40am, before the sunrise as Jupiter then becomes invisible due to the sunlight) with my Canon EOS 550D attached to my telescope via a T2 adapter especially tailored for Canon DSLRs. While this adapter does wonders compared to aligning a mobile phone camera with the eye piece, it also attaches directly to the telescope and thus, takes no advantage of any lens-enabling magnification.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The result is what you see below. I&#8217;ve cropped the photos to show only the section where Jupiter and its moons are.

D. degree at the Delft University of Technology. This journey has, on itself, come to an end at my Ph. D. defense last Friday, 20th of March 2015. On this date I defended my thesis titled Web Service Growing Pains: Understanding Services and Their Clients (available online for free at the TU Delft repository: [link](http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4233\/uuid:0b513351-7ce5-438c-b266-56fd9838b543)).\n\nThis thesis and Ph. D. defense culminate four years of struggle as a Ph. D. student. While some would consider the Ph. D. life as a relaxing and comfortable life, my experience was somewhat different. While I did have relaxing periods and got the chance to visit many different places by virtue of attending conferences, work-satisfaction-wise my experience\u00a0is better described as a struggle. \u00a0My experience is that of one day being told that regarding the Ph. D.\u00a0*\u201cyou\u2019re at the steering wheel\u201d* while the next day having my ideas consistently turned down without an explanation clearer than\u00a0*\u201cmy experience tells me this will not get accepted\u201d*.\n\nMy supervisor, in the\u00a0customary\u00a0*laudatio* speech which proceeds the defense ever so\u2026 wisely\u2026 articulated that he had hoped I had learned something out of this doctorate degree.\u00a0In fact, he should be so proud to know that I did learn thoroughly from this experience.\n\nOne of the lessons learned is that, project-wise, it\u2019s probably best if you\u2019re exactly on the same page as your supervisor before the project even starts. By \u201csame page\u201d I mean that you\u2019d better have a very clear picture of what it is that is expected of you. Otherwise you may be walking into a situation where your supervisor expects you to imagine, or perhaps dream, or even invent work to do whilst you will be clueless as what it is that hits *his* (or her) spot. Are you thinking about starting a Ph. D.? Then I suggest that before you even sign the contract, you sit together with whoever will be supervising you and draft a concrete plan of how you will approach your research.\n\nAnother very important lesson I learned, and one which I plan on making use of fully, is the distinction between [a boss and a leader](http:\/\/www.inc.com\/lolly-daskal\/the-choice-is-yours-boss-or-leader-pick-one.html). This article from Inc. distinguishes them both in a few bullet points and is of particular importance to check out for when dealing with whoever will be your daily supervisor. Some of those you may want to look at are:\n\n- Does your supervisor drive you or does (s)he coach you towards your best performance? - I learned that a coach is someone highly learned and interactive. Someone who is full of ideas. As a Ph. D. student you may at times feel like you\u2019re way above your league and cannot find a rope that leads you to the shore. If your supervisor is competent and good at his job, (s)he\u2019ll be flooding you with ideas which you can then sort and keep those which both interest you and which you think are feasible (both very important traits for Ph. D. research).\n- Does your supervisor instill fear in you or does (s)he inspire enthusiasm in you? - Try to identify whether your supervisor uses fear as a driver for his employees. Is your supervisor the kind of person who walks into your office and threatens you that you will not get your Ph. D. unless you do better work? Then you may want to either choose another supervisor, or if that\u2019s not possible then consider whether you really want to be doing work with this type of person.\n- The boss says Go!; the leader says Let\u2019s go! - Your supervisor can, generally speaking, be one of two types of people: he can either see you and him\/herself in the same team, or he can see you as his personal paper-churning, h-index boosting machine. When your supervisor sees you as a team-mate in producing quality research, (s)he\u2019ll her\/himself come up with ideas for potential research leads. After all, they\u2019ve been doing this much longer than you have. If he, on the other hand, sees you as his personal ghostwriter, he\u2019ll delegate all this work to you. It\u2019s fair enough that you should do the research and cover the ground, you\u2019re [the expert](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg) after all, but your supervisor\u2019s name is also going to be on the paper so make sure you are (again) on the same page as to what each of you is contributing to the research and make sure both of you are okay with it.\n\n\n","html":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As some of my readers will know, ever since November 2010 I had been pursuing a Ph. D. degree at the Delft University of Technology. This journey has, on itself, come to an end at my Ph. D. defense last Friday, 20th of March 2015. On this date I defended my thesis titled Web Service Growing Pains: Understanding Services and Their Clients (available online for free at the TU Delft repository: <a href=\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4233\/uuid:0b513351-7ce5-438c-b266-56fd9838b543\">link<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This thesis and Ph. D. defense culminate four years of struggle as a Ph. D. student. While some would consider the Ph. D. life as a relaxing and comfortable life, my experience was somewhat different. While I did have relaxing periods and got the chance to visit many different places by virtue of attending conferences, work-satisfaction-wise my experience\u00a0is better described as a struggle. \u00a0My experience is that of one day being told that regarding the Ph. D.\u00a0<em>&#8220;you&#8217;re at the steering wheel&#8221;<\/em> while the next day having my ideas consistently turned down without an explanation clearer than\u00a0<em>&#8220;my experience tells me this will not get accepted&#8221;<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My supervisor, in the\u00a0customary\u00a0<em>laudatio<\/em> speech which proceeds the defense ever so&#8230; wisely&#8230; articulated that he had hoped I had learned something out of this doctorate degree.\u00a0In fact, he should be so proud to know that I did learn thoroughly from this experience.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the lessons learned is that, project-wise, it&#8217;s probably best if you&#8217;re exactly on the same page as your supervisor before the project even starts. By &#8220;same page&#8221; I mean that you&#8217;d better have a very clear picture of what it is that is expected of you.

It\u2019d always baffled me why would people use such a barebones editor over a proper IDE but I figured, if so many people were using it and following it almost as a cult, there\u00a0*must* be something to it. So I sat down and forced myself to learn some basics to get me started. And, of course, I started by learning how to\u00a0*quit* the editor (relevant\u00a0side joke:\u00a0*Q: How do you generate a random string? A: Put a Windows user in front of vi, and tell them to exit.*), learned about the different modes and I learned basic things like moving forwards and backwards by units of words, and how to delete multiple lines and how to go to a certain line, etc. Basically the kind of thing I would be faced with whilst using vim to actually achieve something programming-wise.\n\n[Continue Reading]\n\nAnd it was glorious.\n\nThe muscle memory started forming and it became second nature. Vim became part of my tool belt and, when it came to editing files, I started to use it for\u00a0*everything. *Delete lines in bulk? Got it. Search and replace the whole document with regular expressions? Piece of cake. Moving around the document by using search rather than painstakingly scrolling my way to it? Hell yeah.\n\nAs part of my vim usage, I also created a very small .vimrc which loaded some basic plugins and set the tabbing policies to something sensible (spaces master race!), but that was it, and all was well.\n\nThen one day, I woke up and thought: *\u201cheh, it\u2019s funny, I\u2019ve heard about the [editor war](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Editor_war) but I never really took the time to see what\u2019s on the other side of the fence\u201d* and so I decided to climb the fence and have a quick peek. I equipped myself with emacs and, again, forced myself to go through the same bootcamp I had forced myself to years earlier with vim. Not only did I do the same thing, but because my muscle memory was already developed around vim, I started noting down the key combinations for the most common things I was doing in vim, except this time in emacs.\n\nEditor-wise, I didn\u2019t feel much difference in productivity. It was when I started exploring the different plugins and available customizations that I got really hooked. You see, emacs has its equivalent of the .vimrc file, the init.el. Here is where you can load plugins and set configuration variables to be loaded on emacs\u2019 startup. While in the process of trying to customize emacs to behave the same way *my* vim was behaving with regards to tabbing and directory explorer (I was using NERDTree)\u00a0I found out how that in emacs you can simply set up\u00a0MELPA, emacs\u2019 package repository, and install everything through it. Emacs has its own package repository. Mind blown. Every single mainstream plugin is available at the distance of Alt + X (M-x in emacs notation), writing package-install, and then typing the name of the package. It\u2019s like your editor has its own version of\u00a0*apt-get*.\n\nSince this exotic new editor (which contrary to vim is always in edit mode) was allowing me to discover, install and configure a whole range of plugins through a package repository, I started installing and configuring. That\u2019s when mind blown #2 came. To load and configure this plugins via the\u00a0*init.el* file I was writing elisp code. That\u2019s right, emacs is built around elisp, its own dialect of a functional programming lisp language. I\u2019d never done any functional programming before, but damn, I was enjoying it thoroughly. I\u2019d never done any Vimscript before but I\u2019d heard horror stories about it, and elisp, by opposition, was being a walk in a very pleasant park with a warm breeze flowing through.\n\nAfter all was said and done, and after gradually (over the course of days) customizing my init.el to my liking, my emacs was looking no different than a fancy Atom or Sublime Text. Below you\u2019ll find a comparison of what emacs looks like out of the box (courtesy of GNU) and what\u00a0*my* emacs looks like sporting the monokai theme:![splash](https:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/splash.png)\n\n![Capture](https:\/\/www.tiagoespinha.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Capture-1024x718.png)\n\nNow, a few weeks later, I look back and I think I would have done it all the same. However, beware,\u00a0*don\u2019t* get into emacs unless you really have the time to spare to have a whole new world opened to you. Are you already a functional programming guru? Then step right ahead, you\u2019ll feel right at home with emacs. Otherwise, you\u2019ll find yourself discovering\u00a0*more* than an editor. Emacs was once jokingly defined as a \u201cgreat operating system, lacking only a decent editor\u201d. I disagree. It\u00a0*is* an operating system, but the editor itself is awesome and kicks vim out of the park any time. By the way, did I mention that vim was\u00a0*implemented\u00a0*within emacs?
