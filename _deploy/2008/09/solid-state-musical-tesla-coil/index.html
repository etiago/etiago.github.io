<meta name="description" content="Ok, so this isn&#8217;t much in concordance with what I have posted before but hey, it is still technology at its peak and I loved the concept. For those who don&#8217;t know, Tesla Coils get their name from their inventor, Nikola Tesla. The initial idea was to actually transport energy through wireless means, very much like Intel is attempting except that with Intel&#8217;s plans apparently there&#8217;s no human electrocution involved. I know, sad 🙁 .              Anyhow, I&#8217;m going to leave you to the point of this blog post which is the use of Tesla Coils pretty much as speakers. Some guys built the paraphernalia needed to convert musical waves into digital tones, so that they can afterwards be used as triggers to the coils. Typically we wouldn&#8217;t hear such a coil ressonate, but the whole idea is that they turn the coil on and off enough times per second to insert the noise into a range that is actually audible by humans. You can learn more about it on this video, which explains it briefly. Don&#8217;t bother if you&#8217;re not a tech geek.              Now, to the actual amazing videos, we have:              Tetris Theme Mario Bros Theme Zelda Theme Ghostbusters Theme                       Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did, simply because it jaw-dropped me. If you did enjoy it, please feel free to drop me a comment, or better yet, DIGG this article 😀 .              As an end note, if you like this concept, I would also recommend watching the movie The Prestige with the great Christian Bale (I&#8217;m sorry, now I&#8217;m just teasing the Batman fans&#8230;) which happens to be one of my favourite movies of all time. Enjoy!">
