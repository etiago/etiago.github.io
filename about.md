  I have a BSc from the School of Technology and Management of Leiria (ESTG Leiria) in Informatics[sic] Engineering. My major (known as branch in the Portuguese naming system) is in Information Systems. Since I always strive to be the best at what I do, I felt that my education was a little short to have significance in the labor market; with that said, I went to the UK in September 2009 where I have obtained my Master&#8217;s degree in Advanced Software Engineering at the University of Leicester. On top of this main educational path, I also have other certifications such as the Computer Technician degree obtained in High School and the Cisco Certified Network Associate 1 (CCNA1).

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As of September 2010 I was accepted as a PhD student at the TU Delft, in the Netherlands, where I am currently spending four years doing research in the field of multi-tenant software systems. This is a very exciting new endeavor in my life and one that I am really looking forward to. For more information about my research, please feel free to have a look at my <a href="http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/~tiago">department website</a>, where you can also find all my publications so far.

  At heart I am a programmer and I love developing in general, be it web applications or regular standalone applications to use on your computer. So far TeddyBearNotes is my flagship creation but I have been part of other projects as a developer, like the MMORPG Mafia game, <a href="http://www.barafranca.com/" target="_blank">Omerta</a>. More recently I also entirely developed a website for a hairdresser business, of its name <a href="http://www.paulaespinha.com" target="_blank">Paula Espinha Cabeleireiros</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As side projects I have been participating in some of Google&#8217;s contests, such as the Google Code Jam or the Google Summer of Code. I was a participant in the 2009 edition of the GSoC and I completed it successfully. It was a wonderful experience which provided me with plenty of knowledge and also quite a few soft-skills. As last year&#8217;s experience was so rewarding and fulfilling, I decided to apply for GSoC again in 2010 and completed my project successfully once again. As of my last participation with the Apache Software Foundation, I was voted and accepted to become a committer within the ASF ranks. As a reward for my continuous collaboration with the ASF, and after mentoring two other students through Google Summer of Code, I have recently been promoted to the Program Management Committee of which I am now part.

  I keep this blog because I am thoroughly fond of writing, and because secretly I have the fantasy that people will care to read it. Or actually, since I&#8217;m being paid to write some of the posts I write (the sponsored ones), you could say that I&#8217;m actually a professional writer, but I&#8217;ll let you be the judge of that!
