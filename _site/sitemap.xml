        <title>Why I started using emacs (and why you shouldn&amp;#8217;t)</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  In what feels like a long time ago, I &amp;#8211; as the curious software engineer that I am &amp;#8211; began a journey. I had decided to try vim (&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;wha&amp;#8230;? It said emacs in the title&amp;#8230; is this the right art&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8212; yes it is, just keep on reading). It&amp;#8217;d always baffled me why would people use such a barebones editor over a proper IDE but I figured, if so many people were using it and following it almost as a cult, there &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be something to it. So I sat down and forced myself to learn some basics to get me started. And, of course, I started by learning how to &lt;em&gt;quit&lt;/em&gt; the editor (relevant side joke: &lt;em&gt;Q: How do you generate a random string? A: Put a Windows user in front of vi, and tell them to exit.&lt;/em&gt;), learned about the different modes and I learned basic things like moving forwards and backwards by units of words, and how to delete multiple lines and how to go to a certain line, etc. Basically the kind of thing I would be faced with whilst using vim to actually achieve something programming-wise.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  [Continue Reading]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  And it was glorious.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The muscle memory started forming and it became second nature. Vim became part of my tool belt and, when it came to editing files, I started to use it for &lt;em&gt;everything. &lt;/em&gt;Delete lines in bulk? Got it. Search and replace the whole document with regular expressions? Piece of cake. Moving around the document by using search rather than painstakingly scrolling my way to it? Hell yeah.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  As part of my vim usage, I also created a very small .vimrc which loaded some basic plugins and set the tabbing policies to something sensible (spaces master race!), but that was it, and all was well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Then one day, I woke up and thought: &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;heh, it&amp;#8217;s funny, I&amp;#8217;ve heard about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war&quot;&gt;editor war&lt;/a&gt; but I never really took the time to see what&amp;#8217;s on the other side of the fence&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; and so I decided to climb the fence and have a quick peek. I equipped myself with emacs and, again, forced myself to go through the same bootcamp I had forced myself to years earlier with vim. Not only did I do the same thing, but because my muscle memory was already developed around vim, I started noting down the key combinations for the most common things I was doing in vim, except this time in emacs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Editor-wise, I didn&amp;#8217;t feel much difference in productivity. It was when I started exploring the different plugins and available customizations that I got really hooked. You see, emacs has its equivalent of the .vimrc file, the init.el. Here is where you can load plugins and set configuration variables to be loaded on emacs&amp;#8217; startup. While in the process of trying to customize emacs to behave the same way &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; vim was behaving with regards to tabbing and directory explorer (I was using NERDTree) I found out how that in emacs you can simply set up MELPA, emacs&amp;#8217; package repository, and install everything through it. Emacs has its own package repository. Mind blown. Every single mainstream plugin is available at the distance of Alt + X (M-x in emacs notation), writing package-install, and then typing the name of the package. It&amp;#8217;s like your editor has its own version of &lt;em&gt;apt-get&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Since this exotic new editor (which contrary to vim is always in edit mode) was allowing me to discover, install and configure a whole range of plugins through a package repository, I started installing and configuring. That&amp;#8217;s when mind blown #2 came. To load and configure this plugins via the &lt;em&gt;init.el&lt;/em&gt; file I was writing elisp code. That&amp;#8217;s right, emacs is built around elisp, its own dialect of a functional programming lisp language. I&amp;#8217;d never done any functional programming before, but damn, I was enjoying it thoroughly. I&amp;#8217;d never done any Vimscript before but I&amp;#8217;d heard horror stories about it, and elisp, by opposition, was being a walk in a very pleasant park with a warm breeze flowing through.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After all was said and done, and after gradually (over the course of days) customizing my init.el to my liking, my emacs was looking no different than a fancy Atom or Sublime Text. Below you&amp;#8217;ll find a comparison of what emacs looks like out of the box (courtesy of GNU) and what &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; emacs looks like sporting the monokai theme:&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-775 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/splash.png&quot; alt=&quot;splash&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;453&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/splash.png 722w, https://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/splash-300x272.png 300w, https://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/splash-500x453.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-774 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture-1024x718.png&quot; alt=&quot;Capture&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture-1024x718.png 1024w, https://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture-300x210.png 300w, https://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture-768x538.png 768w, https://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture-500x350.png 500w, https://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture-900x631.png 900w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Now, a few weeks later, I look back and I think I would have done it all the same. However, beware, &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#8217;t&lt;/em&gt; get into emacs unless you really have the time to spare to have a whole new world opened to you. Are you already a functional programming guru? Then step right ahead, you&amp;#8217;ll feel right at home with emacs. Otherwise, you&amp;#8217;ll find yourself discovering &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than an editor. Emacs was once jokingly defined as a &amp;#8220;great operating system, lacking only a decent editor&amp;#8221;. I disagree. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an operating system, but the editor itself is awesome and kicks vim out of the park any time. By the way, did I mention that vim was &lt;em&gt;implemented &lt;/em&gt;within emacs? You will be able to use your tested and tried vim experience with all the goodness of emacs. What&amp;#8217;s more to want?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Have fun with emacs and tell me about your experiences in the comments section below. Until the next time.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stuck at &amp;#8220;Preparing your Desktop&amp;#8221; After Migrating Windows Partition to SSD?</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Recently at work I helped a colleague migrating his laptop from a HDD to an SSD. He was dual-booting his machine with Windows 7 and Ubuntu, and after skillfully shrinking his original partitions (in order to fit the SSD), we copied the partitions over with dd from the HDD to the SSD. After that was done, Grub was understandably confused as its entries were pointing to the HDD partitions rather than the SSD partitions but even after an update-grub and grub-install from within Ubuntu, Windows still wouldn&amp;#8217;t boot.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  We consistently got stuck at &amp;#8220;Preparing your Desktop&amp;#8221; screen and eventually Windows would boot into a completely empty desktop.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Keep reading to figure out how to fix this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Even though my Windows skills have rusted from having fully migrated to Arch Linux a while back, I still remembered you could run programs from the task manager which, conveniently, is still possible to launch using the Ctrl+Alt+Del combination. Having done so allowed me to diagnose the problem: when I ran cmd.exe, Windows was mounting the SSD partition from which I was trying to boot as F:\ rather than C:\ where Windows expected everything to be.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The fix, after you know what to do, is simple-ish.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Essentially you need to change your registry (you know, regedit) and remove all the letter mappings so that Windows will remap all your drives again at boot.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Easy right? Just launch regedit and edit away! But NO! Because you will, with 100% certainty, not be able to launch regedit!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So what&amp;#8217;s the solution then, how can you edit your registry without actually being able to boot into Windows?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Nice question! We do it from Ubuntu using a nifty tool called chntpw which was originally developed (I assume&amp;#8230; based on the name&amp;#8230;) to change the password of NT-based systems.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So! Jump on Ubuntu, get yourself chntpw installed (seriously, if you don&amp;#8217;t know how to do this, get a friend to help you as the next steps are VERY sensitive!) and do the following steps:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Mount your Windows partition (from now on called &lt;WindowsPartition&gt;).
  &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Run chntpw -i &lt;WindowsPartition&gt;/Windows/System32/config/system (N.B. Windows is not case-sensitive but Linux is! Therefore, your file might be called SYSTEM).
  &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    From the menu, choose option 9 (Registry Editor).
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Now if you type &amp;#8220;ls&amp;#8221;, one of the items should be &amp;#8220;MountedDevices&amp;#8221;.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Enter it by typing &amp;#8220;cd MountedDevices&amp;#8221;.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Again if you &amp;#8220;ls&amp;#8221;, a number of entries should appear, including all your drive letter mappings (we&amp;#8217;re almost there!).
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Now, I had no success actually &lt;em&gt;changing&lt;/em&gt; the mappings so I ended up simply removing all the mappings and letting Windows remapping on the next boot. To do so type &amp;#8221; dv \DosDevices\C:&amp;#8221; and repeat this command for all the mapped letters in your computer.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Do &amp;#8220;ls&amp;#8221; one more time to confirm the mappings have been deleted.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Choose option &amp;#8220;q&amp;#8221; to quit chntpw followed by &amp;#8220;y&amp;#8221; to confirm writing the registry hive file.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    TADA! You&amp;#8217;re done! Boot into Windows and it should finally boot correctly.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Let me know in the comments if you&amp;#8217;re stuck in some step and I&amp;#8217;ll gladly give a hand!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Till the next time!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/WindowsPartition&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/WindowsPartition&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Disable power management for the 8188eu driver in Raspbian</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many WIFI USB dongles out there rely on the 8188eu driver for support under Linux. In fact, in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/2014/04/how-to-get-the-tp-link-tl-wn725n-working-on-raspberry-pi/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;  I covered how to compile a 8188eu driver for your own Raspbian kernel which will keep being upgraded if you are vigilant enough to run rpi-update every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I didn’t mention in that blog post is that certain devices which use this chipset will enter power management mode after some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is the case with your device, you can fix it by creating a file called /etc/modprobe.d/8188eu.conf which loads the configuration for the 8188eu kernel module and write the following inside:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;options 8188eu rtw_power_mgnt=0 rtw_enusbss=0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then restart your Raspbian and you should be good to go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>[Photo] Jupiter and its 4 largest moons</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  As some of you may know, I have recently taken up a new hobby. I started with (very) amateur astronomy. Now while the Dutch skies are not the best for astronomy due to having &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0108052&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; worst&lt;/a&gt; light pollution in Europe (probably due to its extensive greenhouses and the artificial lightning they require), it&amp;#8217;s still possible to see the closer objects to Earth such as the planets in our own solar system.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  [Continue reading, photos below]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  While I had seen Jupiter in multiple occasions before, as it is visible with the naked eye, seeing its four largest moons live (Europa, Io, Ganymede and Callisto) was definitely a first for me. Believe me when I say that the photograph does not do justice to the real thing and it is indeed a pity. The photo has been taken last Sunday morning (October 5th 2014 at 6:40am, before the sunrise as Jupiter then becomes invisible due to the sunlight) with my Canon EOS 550D attached to my telescope via a T2 adapter especially tailored for Canon DSLRs. While this adapter does wonders compared to aligning a mobile phone camera with the eye piece, it also attaches directly to the telescope and thus, takes no advantage of any lens-enabling magnification.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The result is what you see below. I&amp;#8217;ve cropped the photos to show only the section where Jupiter and its moons are. Despite not being as good as looking at it through a 10mm lens on a 3x Barlow (totaling a 400x zoom), it&amp;#8217;s still quite a sight 🙂 .
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Keep scrolling for the photos and until the next time!

        <title>Wat is alcohol ketonatus? (What is alcohol ketonatus?)</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  In het Nederlands: een simpel en een-zin antwoord is &lt;em&gt;alcohol ketonatus is alcohol die door gebruik van een ketone (meestal is butanon in Nederland gebruikt) zijn geur veranderd is om het ondrinkbaar te maken. Het zou dus niet gebruikt zijn om te drinken (waarom willen mensen 96% alcohol drinken is wel buiten mijn verstanding maar ja&amp;#8230;)&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  In English: A simple and one-sentence answer is &lt;em&gt;alcohol ketonatus is the Dutch nomenclature for alcohol that&amp;#8217;s been &amp;#8220;denaturated&amp;#8221;. Essentially, alcohol that through the usage of a ketone (in the Netherlands it&amp;#8217;s usually butanone) is made undrinkable and should not be used for human consumption.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/96759.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[731]&quot; title=&quot;Wat is alcohol ketonatus? (What is alcohol ketonatus?)&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-732&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/96759.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;96759&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &amp;#8212;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Some background&amp;#8230; whilst living in the Netherlands, I often wondered why was &amp;#8220;pure alcohol&amp;#8221; nowhere to be found. There&amp;#8217;s the alcohol shops, and the supermarkets, and they all sell wines and all kinds of distilled drinks but I could never find the pure &lt;em&gt;ethanol&lt;/em&gt; which we in Portugal use to cook &lt;em&gt;chouriça&lt;/em&gt; laid on an &lt;em&gt;assador de barro&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  It turns out such ethanol &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; exist and I found it on DIO (even though I later realized both etos and Kruidvat also sell them). Upon browsing through their online shop, I found a so-called &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;alcohol ketonatus&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; which left me wondering what was this &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;ketonatus&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; all about. Was this what I was looking for? Or was this some weird concoction and not suitable for what I needed?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After looking around I couldn&amp;#8217;t find a conclusive answer (even on Dutch websites) on what this &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;alcohol ketonatus&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; was&amp;#8230; and that&amp;#8217;s when I decided to figure out what exactly was this &amp;#8220;ketonation&amp;#8221; process. Lo-and-behold, &amp;#8220;ketonation&amp;#8221; is basically what reads in the Portuguese alcohol bottles as &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;desnaturado&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;, that is, made improper for human consumption.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  And now you know. If you&amp;#8217;re Portuguese and you&amp;#8217;re in the market for &lt;em&gt;álcool etílico desnaturado&lt;/em&gt;, just buy &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;alcohol ketonatus&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; from your local DIO/Kruidvat/etos 😉
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Pro tip&lt;/strong&gt;: If you&amp;#8217;re Portuguese, get yourself a hold of someone in Portugal who makes his/her own &lt;em&gt;bagaço/aguardente&lt;/em&gt; and use that instead. You&amp;#8217;ll get a better aftertaste and hey, that one can actually be drank!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Pro tip 2&lt;/strong&gt;: If you really don&amp;#8217;t know anyone who can get you a supply of &lt;em&gt;aguardente&lt;/em&gt;, or if you don&amp;#8217;t travel back to Portugal often enough, then make friends with a Chinese! Odds are they can get you some 白酒 (pronounced &lt;em&gt;bái jiǔ&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;bai2jiu3&lt;/em&gt; or just show them the Chinese characters&amp;#8230;) which is just as good or even better!
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to see the International Space Station (ISS)</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Last weekend me and my wife were down in Eindhoven in the south of what was a very sunny and warm Netherlands. While visiting a friend down there we discovered they have a telescope. Oh, I was so excited! For many years, having a telescope has been a dream of mine but alas&amp;#8230; they aren&amp;#8217;t exactly cheap instruments and I always had the feeling it would be something that would get old pretty fast.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  However, as soon as I had the chance to point the telescope at the tiny shiny blimp in the sky which turned out to be Saturn, and as soon as I was able to see its rings hanging around its spherical mass of gas, I was in love. &amp;#8220;Wait, let&amp;#8217;s point it at the moon!&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; and I was even more in love. Somehow there is some astronomic quality and reality to seeing things through that glorified mirror-lined tube that photos simply cannot capture. Much the same way a single photograph cannot capture the greatness of the Great Wall, much the same way photos cannot describe the feeling of a plane banking to 30 degrees inclination to pull you out of the floor, out to 39000 feet to take you places&amp;#8230; astronomic photographs, as spectacular and colorful as they may be, cannot describe the feeling of DIY pointing the telescope and sitting there looking, wondering, imagining.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This means, of course, one thing: for the next few months I will be badgering my wife, trying to persuade her to allow me to invest in a good telescope.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Part of this persuasion started last night when the ISS was flying past us at its incredible speed. Normally the ISS would only be visible in the wee hours of the night and we would have to wait for the right day where all the conditions were met. You need a clear sky, the station to be passing around your area and patience to wake up in the middle of the night to see it. But last night at 23:13 would be a perfect time to spot it. Our plan was almost foiled by the patchy clouds which were planning to ruin the fun but a couple of minutes past the announced time, there it was, in all its glory. A small patch of reflected light, in total size bigger than any star, bigger indeed than any planet  and about as big as one of the planes which usually make for the Rotterdam/The Hague airport around the same area. But this one was different. It was not blinking but rather reflecting light, constantly so, and flying at a different bearing than of the planes. Hiding here and there behind one of the clouds, it was as visible as it could be in the sky which at that time was not yet so dark. In effect, as I recall, the sky&amp;#8217;s light night blue was probably the best to spot the station. Too dark and the station&amp;#8217;s colors would get lost in the background, too light and it is simply not visible at all, overexposed by the sunlight. It&amp;#8217;s pretty tough to find a photo of what we saw last night, mostly because spotting the ISS with the naked eye requires conditions which are very adverse to photography (darkness + fast moving objects) so here&amp;#8217;s a photo of the ISS in all its glory (photo courtesy of Wikipedia):
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/International_Space_Station_after_undocking_of_STS-132.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[712]&quot; title=&quot;How to see the International Space Station (ISS)&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-713&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/International_Space_Station_after_undocking_of_STS-132.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;International_Space_Station_after_undocking_of_STS-132&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;306&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This was it, this was yet another step towards my space exploration. Yet another step in convincing my wife the 300 euro I need for a telescope will be worth it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Oh yeah, my post&amp;#8217;s title was about how to see the ISS, right? Oh that&amp;#8217;s pretty easy&amp;#8230; If you have a smartphone, specifically Android, you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.runar.issdetector&quot;&gt;ISS Detector&lt;/a&gt; app. Fill in your location and you&amp;#8217;re good to go. Otherwise just head over to NASA&amp;#8217;s very own &amp;#8220;Spot the Station&amp;#8221;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/&quot;&gt;http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/&lt;/a&gt; . It&amp;#8217;s really worth it and you should definitely give it a go.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;EDIT: &lt;/strong&gt;Last night we were &amp;#8220;station spotting&amp;#8221; again and I managed to snap a picture of the ISS in all its glory. In a surprisingly clear sky, I feel that the photo does not make justice to the real thing but indeed, it is better than nothing!
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>[Project] How to easily monitor your plants&amp;#8217; soil humidity</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  You came here to learn about soil humidity monitoring, right?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Then you should probably scroll down to the part where I have a photo of my setup. However, if you have the time and feel like reading some of my ramblings, why don&amp;#8217;t you just continue with the next paragraph? I promise you won&amp;#8217;t be disappointed!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  My beginning as an urban farmer
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Spring is here and with it comes the sunshine, even in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands#Climate&quot;&gt;rainy Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;. For this reason I recently started growing all kinds of things at home. First I started with some of those tiny thumb-sized vases which come bundled with sunflower and lavender seeds but&amp;#8230; soon after, I realized those vases were not gonna be big enough to hold that many seeds. Determined to see those plants through to flowering, I started buying bigger vases and soil. Soon after that, I was growing not only the sunflowers and lavender but I sowed some seeds I had bought a long time ago. I was now growing several shoots of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimosa_pudica&quot;&gt;mimosa pudica&lt;/a&gt; (aka the shy plant, famous for the fact that it closes its leaves when you poke it &amp;#8211; which you can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLTcVNyOhUc&quot;&gt;on Youtube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;, a few more seedlings of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allium_tuberosum&quot;&gt;chinese chives&lt;/a&gt; (or scientifically speaking, allium tuberosum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, delicious in many dishes)&lt;/em&gt; and my proudest plantation, seedlings of the hottest pepper in the world: the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_moruga_scorpion&quot;&gt;trinidad moruga scorpion&lt;/a&gt;, which i&lt;/em&gt;n the the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale&quot;&gt;Scoville scale&lt;/a&gt; is said to be approximately 500 times hotter than your average Jalapeño or Chipotle chilli. Now THAT&amp;#8217;S spicy!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  You like the post so far? Well keep on reading then!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Okay, I became a farmer.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Yeah okay, I didn&amp;#8217;t start farming because the weather was nice. Most people who face the same circumstances will just go to the beach or do a barbecue or just have a beer with friends in the sunshine but&amp;#8230; I realized I like farming. In a more and more brick and mortar world where everywhere there&amp;#8217;s buildings and cars and in a world where more and more the artificial replaces the natural, it is nice to have a small piece of nature close by.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  At this point I had a substantial collection of vases and it didn&amp;#8217;t take me long to realize that I sometimes would forget my plants and the soil would be bone dry. Whilst plants make for great landscape, they are very unobtrusive and don&amp;#8217;t exactly ask for water the same way my cat used to. So I decided to put my skills to good use and do something about it. After some browsing on eBay I found the perfect tool for the task: soil moisture sensors. It is important that you realize that these sensors are nothing but metal plates with a silicon coating so don&amp;#8217;t expect anything too fancy and always remember the adage: you get what you pay for.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The sensors themselves are pretty useless but I had a few Raspberry Pi boards laying around so I started investigating whether it would be possible to take analog readouts with it, which, to my dismay, was not possible. At least not without using a USB soundcard (it&amp;#8217;s pretty ingenious actually&amp;#8230; when you think of it, what&amp;#8217;s sound if not analog current waves at different frequencies?). So I decided to be more professional and bought an old friend of mine: an Arduino Nano board which can take all kinds of readouts. It does have however the inconvenient of not being able to push the readouts anywhere. You can&amp;#8217;t connect it to a network which means you can&amp;#8217;t exactly take the data out into a database and plot it without additional devices and so the Raspberry Pi came to rescue!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Time to join the forces of my inner farmer and inner nerd together!
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  What was my goal then? I wanted to build a setup that would allow me to plot a nice graph with a live readout from my plants&amp;#8217; soil humidity. Two problems there: to plot a graph you&amp;#8217;ll need to store the data somewhere and&amp;#8230; with the cheap soil moisture sensors I had bought, &amp;#8220;live&amp;#8221; was not going to be possible. &lt;strong&gt;This is something I cannot stress enough: if you&amp;#8217;ll use the same sensors as me, do NOT leave them powered for longer than what is needed to take the readout.&lt;/strong&gt; Below in this post I explain why.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So in the end, I setup the following (photo below):
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &amp;#8211; Raspberry Pi, connected to my home network (the red UTP cable).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &amp;#8211; Arduino, plugged to the soil moisture sensors and connected via USB to the Raspberry Pi.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_694&quot; style=&quot;width: 522px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-05-09-12.13.19.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[689]&quot; title=&quot;[Project] How to easily monitor your plants&#39; soil humidity&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-694&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-05-09-12.13.19.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Raspberry Pi + Arduino wired together&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Raspberry Pi + Arduino wired together
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Then with some of my rusty C code I was able to get the Arduino up and running and sending data back to the Raspberry Pi.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  At this point please understand that there are a &lt;strong&gt;multitude of ways&lt;/strong&gt; in which the &lt;strong&gt;exact same thing can be achieved&lt;/strong&gt;. This is just what I came up with after experimenting with a couple of ways.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  In essence, what I have is: three DuPont cables going from separate digital pins on the RPi which in turn connect to separate digital pins on the Arduino Nano. The Arduino Nano has one digital pin per soil moisture sensor (which is plugged to the VCC in each of the small devices on the right&amp;#8230; they are YL-38 sensors and are explained later) and one analog pin also per soil moisture sensor (plugged to the A0 in the same YL-38 devices, to take the soil moisture readings).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The idea is that periodically the Raspberry Pi will send a signal to the Arduino on a specific digital pin which will then cause the Arduino board to power the small bridge device which in turn outputs an analog readout (essentially an AC wave) which the Arduino listens on and prints to the serial console.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;FRIENDLY ADVICE: &lt;/strong&gt;After reading around, I learned it is best to do this for short periods of time &amp;#8211; namely, not for longer than just a few seconds. If you keep the bridge device powered at all times, your sensor probes will rust within the hour due to the electrolysis which the DC current will cause to the plates. After that happens, your sensor is pretty much garbage as the sensor probes will have corroded and the moisture readouts will have become inaccurate.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Also of note is how the readings might fluctuate just after you powered the sensor. For this reason it is wise to take a series of readings (I take 20) and discard the first few (I discard the first half). Then you might as well just store a burst of readings which you can later plot into a graph.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  What do you need exactly?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  My goal is to merely give you the idea and the very general pointers of how to get around doing something like this. It&amp;#8217;s most definitely not difficult and anyone with a basic understanding of electronics can get it up and running in a matter of hours. This was a lot of fun for me to figure out myself and for this reason I will not publish the code but merely give you, the reader, a general idea of what has to be done. With this and some programming knowledge, you should be able get this up and running in no time. Here&amp;#8217;s a very general walkthrough:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Get both a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino board. It doesn&amp;#8217;t matter which Arduino. There&amp;#8217;s many different types and I&amp;#8217;ve chosen the Nano variant because it strikes a great balance between functionality and form-factor.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    You&amp;#8217;ll also need a breadboard and DuPont wires. You can get these cheaply off eBay and I found that for most of these usages, male to female cables are ideal (the male end goes into the breadboard whereas the female end can plug directly into sensors&amp;#8217; pins).
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Obviously you&amp;#8217;ll also need soil moisture sensors (photo below). There&amp;#8217;s a lot of variety here both in quality and price range. To get started I suggest you look for the cheap kind on eBay where you can get a Chinese-built YL-69 (although I normally just search for &amp;#8216;soil moisture sensor&amp;#8217;) for a little over 2 euro. These sensors also come with a &amp;#8216;middle-man&amp;#8217; circuit which allows you to get two outputs: one is an analog readout of the resistance between the sensor&amp;#8217;s two plates and the second is a digital output (essentially, HIGH or LOW, 5v or 0v) depending on whether the humidity is above or below a threshold which can in turn be adjusted by a built-in POTS. Personally I just take the analog readout and ignore the digital one. This allows me to make pretty graphs like you can see later in this post.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_701&quot; style=&quot;width: 522px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-05-09-12.51.20.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[689]&quot; title=&quot;[Project] How to easily monitor your plants&#39; soil humidity&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-701&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-05-09-12.51.20.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Above, the soil moisture sensor itself (YL-69). Below, the bridge device which you&#39;ll need to use (YL-38).&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Above, the soil moisture sensor itself (YL-69). Below, the bridge device which you&amp;#8217;ll need to use (YL-38).
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After you have all the materials, it&amp;#8217;s very simple to get started. The &lt;strong&gt;YL-69&lt;/strong&gt; sensor itself has two pins which need to be wired to the two pins on the &lt;strong&gt;YL-38&lt;/strong&gt; bridge (specifically, the two isolated pins). On the other end of the YL-38, you have four pins which (top to bottom) represent VCC, GND, D0 and A0. VCC and GND are your power pins which should be set to 3.3/5V and Ground (respectively) and your A0 is an analog output which you will connect to an analog input on the Arduino board (the Arduino Nano has 8 analog pins) via the breadboard.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;FRIENDLY REMINDER: &lt;/strong&gt;DO NOT keep the YL-38 bridge powered for long periods of time. If you leave it permanently on, it will keep applying DC current to the YL-69 sensor which will cause corrosion due to electrolysis. If you want to keep your sensors in good shape for as long as possible, you will only apply power to VCC before you make a reading. Additionally, be sure to at least every week switch the two cables going to the YL-69 sensor as to slow down corrosion as much as possible.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This being said, you&amp;#8217;ll want to plug the VCC on the YL-38 bridge to a digital pin on the Arduino board which you will set to HIGH (thus effectively powering the bridge) before making a reading.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  When you have the Arduino and the sensors all hooked up, you&amp;#8217;ll want to get this plugged to your laptop so you can start experimenting with the code. If you need further help with this part, please drop me a comment or an e-mail (tiagoRemove-me-and-add-at-or-elseEspinha.nl)!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After that&amp;#8217;s done, all you have to do is use one of the GPIO pins in the Raspberry Pi as a signal for the Arduino to start a reading. Essentially my (Python) script does the following goes something like:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    This script first sets a GPIO pin to HIGH.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The Arduino is continuously listening to this pin and once it is raised to HIGH, sets the sensor&amp;#8217;s VCC to HIGH.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The Arduino continuously prints readouts from the sensor to the serial console.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The Python script is reading the USB output (i.e. the serial console) of the Arduino board and storing the readouts.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The Python script sends the readouts to my webserver where they are stored in a database.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Obviously, for this to work you&amp;#8217;ll need the Python libraries for the Raspberry Pi GPIO and I recommend the Python library for dealing with serial devices.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After all&amp;#8217;s said and done, I can generate a graph such as this:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screenshot-2014-05-13-20.35.53.png&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[689]&quot; title=&quot;[Project] How to easily monitor your plants&#39; soil humidity&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-699&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screenshot-2014-05-13-20.35.53.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2014-05-13 20.35.53&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;185&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;But wait, there&amp;#8217;s more!
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;m also the proud owner of a Pebble watch, so why not put this to good use, I thought! Everything was already in place so all I had to do was set up an alert system that monitors the last collected data. If it&amp;#8217;s above a &amp;#8220;drought threshold&amp;#8221;, I receive an alert on my Pebble. But there&amp;#8217;s still more! As soon as I water my plants, I get another alert as seen below:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  To conclude
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Thanks for reading all the way here! I hope my post was of some help for you to start in a similar endeavor. I tried to keep the technicalities (scripts, etc) down to a minimum because, well, that was the most fun part of it and I wouldn&amp;#8217;t want to spoil any of it for you! However, if you get yourself into some trouble and you need some help to move forward, feel free to drop me a comment or, more wisely, drop me an e-mail.

        <title>How to get the TP-Link TL-WN725N working on Raspberry Pi</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Recently I bought two TP-Link TL-WN725N adapters off Amazon. They&amp;#8217;re cheap and according to the RPi peripherals list [&lt;a href=&quot;http://elinux.org/RPi_USB_Wi-Fi_Adapters&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;], are supposed to work well under Linux. They do, however, require a special driver which is not included in the Linux kernel itself. This leaves you with two options:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &amp;#8211; Use one of MrEngman&amp;#8217;s pre-compiled kernel modules which is available on the Raspberry Pi forums [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;amp;t=62371&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;] (kudos to MrEngman to his ongoing effort!).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  or
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &amp;#8211; You compile your own kernel module.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  However, keep in mind the following &lt;strong&gt;very important caveat&lt;/strong&gt;: whatever your choice is, this process requires some basic knowledge of Linux! If you don&amp;#8217;t feel comfortable messing around with kernel modules and such, I would recommend that you proceed with caution and maybe even ask a more experienced friend to give you a hand. It&amp;#8217;s unlikely you will ruin your Raspberry Pi but you may very well ruin your installation. &lt;strong&gt;PROCEED WITH CAUTION.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Now, be aware that if you just want your wifi up and running and don&amp;#8217;t want to be bothered, you really should take the easy way out here and check whether MrEngman has a pre-compiled module that&amp;#8217;s been compiled with the same revision of your kernel. If you cannot find one or if you&amp;#8217;re feeling especially brave, read on for the step by step on how to compile it yourself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Also keep in mind that this tutorial applies to the Raspbian distribution. It may (or may not) work in Pidora (and others) but it&amp;#8217;s up to you to adjust accordingly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Compiling a kernel module
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Be wary, this assumes you&amp;#8217;re going to compile a kernel module to the latest version of the Raspberry Pi firmware (and thus, at the time of writing, for the latest version of the 3.10.y branch). If you&amp;#8217;re not running this version, consider updating [&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update&quot;&gt;updating the RPi to the latest firmware&lt;/a&gt;]!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Pre-requisites
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Linux kernel source for the Raspberry Pi (do &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; use the original Linux kernel as it does not contain all the patches and drivers required for your RPi to work smoothly), available on GitHub [&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/tree/rpi-3.10.y&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;].
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Driver for the RTL8188EU, available on GitHub [&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8188eu&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;].
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Many Linux distributions provide a package just with the precompiled kernel headers and that makes it easier than what you&amp;#8217;ll have to do on the Raspberry Pi. Still, it&amp;#8217;s not so difficult. All you have to do is:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Cloning and compiling the Linux kernel
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  1. Start by cloning the Linux kernel for the RPi
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: bash; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;cd /usr/src/
sudo git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux.git rpi-3.10.y
cd /usr/src/rpi-3.10.y/&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;This will have created a folder called /usr/src/rpi-3.10.y/ where all the Linux kernel source now resides in your Raspberry Pi.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  2. For ease of use, create a symbolic link to the /lib/modules/ structure
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: bash; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;sudo ln -s /usr/src/rpi-3.10.y /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Be sure to write it in as is (or simply copy &amp;amp; paste it in!) as the backticks around uname -r will create the right name for the folder. At this point, your /lib/modules/ path will have a link to the directory where the source code resides. We do this so later when we compile the driver, our life becomes much easier (as the Makefile will automatically look in that directory).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  3. Copy your kernel configuration file to the directory where the source is:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: bash; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;sudo sh -c &#39;zcat /proc/config.gz &amp;gt; .config&#39;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This simply pulls the config from your running kernel into the new kernel you&amp;#8217;re about to compile.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  4. Pull the latest Module.symvers into your kernel&amp;#8217;s directory. Note: this is one of the reasons why I would recommend updating first to the latest kernel, otherwise you&amp;#8217;ll have to figure out which Module.symvers you need.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: bash; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raspberrypi/firmware/master/extra/Module.symvers&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  5. Compile the kernel to a stage that is ready to be linked against kernel modules. You don&amp;#8217;t want to compile the whole kernel since that&amp;#8217;s 1) not necessary for compiling kernel modules and 2) would take ages on a Raspberry Pi with its limited computing power.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: bash; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;sudo make oldconfig
sudo make modules_prepare&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  6. Clone the driver off GitHub, compile it and off you go!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: bash; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;cd /usr/src/
git clone https://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8188eu.git
cd /usr/src/rtl8188eu/
sudo make
sudo make install&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  At this stage, the driver&amp;#8217;s firmware as well as the compiled kernel module have been copied into place but there are a few more considerations to be had.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  1 &amp;#8211; Do &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; plug the wifi dongle with the Raspberry Pi turned on! Many people (including me) have reported that doing so causes the Raspberry Pi to suddenly restart and this can lead to serious corruption of your SD card. Be on the safe side! Shut down your Raspberry Pi (sudo shutdown -h now), plug in the dongle, and turn it back on.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  2 &amp;#8211; At this point, when you run &amp;#8220;ifconfig&amp;#8221; you should already have a wlan0 network which is not connected to anything. In my experience, getting it to connect was the biggest challenge so if you have a WPA/WPA2 network and would like to learn how to connect to it via command line, read on.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Connecting to a WPA/WPA2 network via command line
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  When you know what you&amp;#8217;re doing, this is an extremely simple process. First off, run the following command:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: bash; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;wpa_passphrase &amp;lt;ssid&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Where you should replace &lt;ssid&gt; with the actual SSID of your network (hint: use &amp;#8220;&amp;#8221; if your network&amp;#8217;s name has spaces in it). It will then prompt you to type in the password for your network. This script generates then a few lines in the format of:
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;network={
    ssid=&quot;Foo&quot;
    #psk=&quot;FoobarFoobar&quot;
    psk=f21df897e40a0e7253b8d53e35930e814f312df43ca2b085daa5109f2c2c5e54
}&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I recommend that you delete the line started by #psk (as it reveals your password in clear text) and the rest you should copy and paste into a file at /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf. If it exists, overwrite it, if it does not exist, then create it (with e.g. sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After you&amp;#8217;ve done that, you need to tell Linux how this network is going to get an IP address and how it&amp;#8217;s managed. You can do so by editing the /etc/network/interfaces file as such:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: bash; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Here you should lookout for a line that starts as &amp;#8220;iface wlan0&amp;#8221;. In my case, this line was setting wlan0 as manual which is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; what we want. Ultimately you want something that looks like this:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: bash; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;iface wlan0 inet dhcp
wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  And &lt;strong&gt;watch out!&lt;/strong&gt; If there is a line starting with &amp;#8220;wpa-roam&amp;#8221;, you can safely delete it as it will conflict with your new WPA settings!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After you&amp;#8217;ve modified the file you can then save it and we&amp;#8217;re ready for action. Next thing you need to do is take the WLAN interface down and back up as such:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: bash; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;sudo ifdown wlan0
sudo ifup wlan0&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  And that&amp;#8217;s it! If everything went well, your Raspberry Pi should now be connected to your network via wifi!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  If there&amp;#8217;s something that&amp;#8217;s not clear enough or some steps that I missed, feel free to drop me an e-mail. My e-mail address is my first name [@] my last name [dot] nl. And you can find my first and last name in the url of this blog (hint, my first name is Tiago!).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Finally I would like to thank MrEngman for his dedication and continuous engagement in the Raspberry Pi forums as well as lwfinger for maintaining this driver and making it possible for us to use it on Linux! I would also like to thank Martijn from Grendelman.net for this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grendelman.net/wp/compiling-kernel-modules-for-raspbian-raspberry-pi/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; which helped me in getting all this to work. Thanks! In a future post I will come back and explain how to cross-compile a kernel module for the Raspberry Pi so you can get it done faster by using your (more powerful) desktop computer to do the compilation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ssid&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chronopost Portugal? Serviço enganador&amp;#8230;</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This post will, extraordinarily, be in Portuguese as it is a complaint and a warning towards a Portuguese courier company which is indulging in false advertising. This is, therefore, a warning for my fellow Portuguese countrymen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &amp;#8212;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Esta é uma história de como os meus pais, na segunda-feira passada (dia 7 de Outubro de 2013) me enviaram pela &lt;a href=&quot;http://chronopost.pt/&quot;&gt;Chronopost Portugal&lt;/a&gt; uma encomenda para a Holanda, onde me encontro a residir. No site, a Chronopost anuncia o serviço &lt;a href=&quot;http://chronopost.pt/os-nossos-servicos/servicos-internacionais&quot;&gt;Chronopost Classic&lt;/a&gt; onde prometem entregas para a Europa dentro de 3~4 dias a preços convidativos (24 euros até 10 kg).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Uma vez que a relação preço versus qualidade (anunciada) parecia bastante boa, decidi escolher o serviço da Chronopost.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Qual não é o meu espanto quando hoje, dia 11 de Outubro de 2013, passados 4 dias da expedição da encomenda, esta ainda não se encontra sequer na Holanda (de acordo com o track and trace). Depois de contactar por várias vezes a Chronopost e me terem sido dadas desculpas de que &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;os 4 dias são 4 dias de trânsito&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; e de que &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;o dia de expedição não conta&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;, o facto continua a ser de que excluindo o dia de expedição, faz hoje 4 dias desde que a encomenda se encontra em trânsito.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Após ter descoberto que não vai ser a Chronopost que me vai entregar a encomenda mas sim um dos seus parceiros (a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dpd.com/nl_en&quot;&gt;DPD&lt;/a&gt;), decidi contactar também esta empresa afim de tentar obter um esclarecimento sobre quando a encomenda será entregue. Estes senhores dizem-me que será entregue apenas na &lt;strong&gt;segunda-feira&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;sete dias&lt;/strong&gt; depois da expedição.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Fica aqui então o aviso &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;que a Chronopost Portugal está a &lt;strong&gt;enganar os seus clientes&lt;/strong&gt; com um serviço de pouca fiabilidade, prometendo entregas em 4 dias e fazendo-as em 7 dias. Conhece algum serviço mais fiável? Que tal deixá-lo então na secção de comentários em baixo?
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Automatic Recovery of REST Interfaces</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Recovery of REST interfaces is an interesting research topic which came into conversation with one of our industrial partners and which I would like to explore. This is also something mentioned by Maleshkova et al in their work on &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Investigating Web APIs on the World Wide Web&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://sweet-dev.open.ac.uk/war/Papers/mmaWebAPISurvey.pdf&quot;&gt;pre-print&lt;/a&gt;, I&lt;a href=&quot;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5693251&amp;amp;tag=1&quot;&gt;EEE citable&lt;/a&gt;). The authors claim that &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;two thirds of the APIs do not state the data-type of the input and 40% of the APIs do not state the HTTP method. If a standard interface description language, such as WSDL, [was] used [&amp;#8230;] this would be unthinkable&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This is very true. Read on to know more.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  While SOAP services are always backed up by their WSDL files which describe the interfaces, including all the methods and data types, the much more popular REST services have no such feature. Instead, developers are left with manually created web pages which describe in natural language how to invoke the web API and what the endpoints are; case in point: &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/publishing/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.netflix.com/docs/HTTP_Status_Codes&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;. But what about when web API developers forget to change the documentation, or even worse, make a mistake when specifying the interface? This is when having automatic recovery of the REST interface would prove useful.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The possibilities are endless. This recovery can be done on either client or server side (or both) and each of the sides can add a different view and understanding of the communication. Where with a SOAP-generated WSDL file we know that&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; whatever is in the WSDL file is what&amp;#8217;s available in the system, &lt;em&gt;no more, no less,&lt;/em&gt; by doing recovery of a REST interface we can learn many things:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Client-side recovered interface: whatever is in the recovered interface &lt;em&gt;may or may not&lt;/em&gt; be all that&amp;#8217;s available on the server-side. At any rate, we know that whatever is in the recovered interface represents whatever &lt;strong&gt;features we are using&lt;/strong&gt; of that particular web API (because if we recovered it from runtime data, then our client has at some point used these features).
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Server-side recovered interface: once again, because we&amp;#8217;re recovering the interface from usage data (and even though on the server-side you could probably do a full recovery based on static analysis), whatever we see in the recovered interface is in fact whatever is being used by &lt;strong&gt;ALL&lt;/strong&gt; our clients. This means that if you use long periods of runtime data to recover the interface, you can detect &lt;em&gt;potential dead code.&lt;/em&gt; This is very much the same principle behind code coverage, except we&amp;#8217;re testing interface coverage by client code.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This is, of course, in a very premature stage and in my mind only but it is a thought I wanted to put out there and maybe stir the discussion around this topic a little. If you have any thoughts on this feel free to drop me a comment!

        <title>Ok, I got some kefir, now what? (or Kefir Quickstart Guide)</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  My last post introduced the wonders of kefir and the magic grains that ferment milk into delish yoghurt. Some people have asked me for grains and right now I actually have a &amp;#8220;customer&amp;#8221; on hold for my kefir grains to grow again so I can give them away. It seems my friends are more open than I was actually expecting! Nice!
&lt;/p&gt;

    My own kefir grains!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  Read on for the essential tips on getting quickstarted with kefir making!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Some of you may have also noticed that I&amp;#8217;m posting about kefir in what has otherwise been a &amp;#8220;tech blog&amp;#8221;. But alas, this is my personal blog, and for all I care, kefir grains are actually nanobots which use milk as fuel and drop yoghurt from their behinds (yes, I have a fertile imagination). But no. Kefir grains are really just very much organic yeasts and bacteria which help each other survive and which do, in fact, feed on the fats and nutrients of milk.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Now! You just got some kefir from me (or from anyone else). Now what? What are you supposed to do with this? How can you get kefir milk?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Fret not! Even though I still hold &lt;a href=&quot;http://users.sa.chariot.net.au/~dna/kefirpage.html&quot;&gt;Dom&amp;#8217;s website&lt;/a&gt; as my reference and all my knowledge comes from there, I realize it can be somewhat daunting to go over endless paragraphs of narrative just to learn how to grow kefir. This is why I decided to compile this abridged version that can get you started in no time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Jump here if you&amp;#8217;re an impatient reader
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Okay, first thing you should know: kefir grains will &lt;strong&gt;die&lt;/strong&gt; unless taken care of. Like I said, kefir grains are living bacteria and yeasts and to be kept alive, they should be &lt;strong&gt;in milk at all times&lt;/strong&gt;.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The very second thing you should know is that both kefir grains and the kefir milk itself &lt;strong&gt;should not come in contact with reactive metals&lt;/strong&gt;. Reactive metals are for example copper and aluminum and probably others which I can&amp;#8217;t think of right now. This means that whatever utensil you use with kefir should be &lt;strong&gt;plastic&lt;/strong&gt; or, ultimately, &lt;strong&gt;if you really have to&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;stainless steel&lt;/em&gt; is also tolerable. There&amp;#8217;s a very strong reason for this and there&amp;#8217;s actually a &lt;strong&gt;health danger&lt;/strong&gt; that comes with using reactive metals. Especially if you&amp;#8217;re keeping your kefir in metal bottles, because kefir is an acidic solution (kefir milk has a pH of approximately 4.5) it will react with the metal and you can actually get &lt;strong&gt;very ill in the long term&lt;/strong&gt; from metal poisoning. &lt;strong&gt;SO!&lt;/strong&gt; Use plastic utensils and keep your kefir in glass containers (plastic also works, but I prefer glass). Like I said, stainless steel has very little reactivity (is this even a word?!) and for some time I was using a stainless steel strainer without a problem, but I seriously recommend nylon or plastic.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The third thing about kefir has to do with temperature. To make kefir you&amp;#8217;re gonna place your kefir grains in fresh milk (UHT milk &lt;strong&gt;does not work very well&lt;/strong&gt;) and leave it at &lt;strong&gt;room temperature&lt;/strong&gt;. Now, of course, room temperature is a very arbitrary concept. Room temperature means 24 degrees for me but maybe your house is colder or warmer. Worry not! Kefir can stand a very wide range of temperatures, anything from 20 to 28 degrees will keep your grains happy, keeping in mind that they can also go in the fridge (but this is something that should not be done often). Now, you&amp;#8217;re probably thinking about whether or not it is dangerous to leave &lt;em&gt;fresh milk&lt;/em&gt; at room temperature and the answer is NO! Normally milk would go bad at room temperature in no time, but because you have your kefir grains inside, the good bacteria from kefir give the bad bacteria (that would make the milk go bad) no chance to spread. So yes, keeping the milk at room temperature is &lt;strong&gt;the normal way of making&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;kefir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The fourth thing you should know is that making kefir milk does come with some work involved. For instance, it takes kefir grains approximately 24 hours to convert an appropriately sized portion of milk into kefir milk. This means that &lt;strong&gt;every 24 hours&lt;/strong&gt; you&amp;#8217;ll be straining your kefir milk and placing the strained grains in fresh milk. As you can imagine, unless you really like kefir, you&amp;#8217;re gonna get tired after doing this every 24 hours. Still, again, worry not! Even if you&amp;#8217;re not an avid kefir milk drinker, there&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;a way out&lt;/em&gt;. Like I said before, keeping the kefir grains in milk at room temperature is &lt;em&gt;the normal way&lt;/em&gt; of making kefir. Still, you can also keep the milk with the grains in the fridge. At fridge temperature, it will take the grains &lt;strong&gt;a week&lt;/strong&gt; before they ferment the milk into kefir milk. While this sounds like the perfect solution, &lt;strong&gt;do keep in mind&lt;/strong&gt; that every once in a while you should do 2 or 3 batches of kefir at room temperature. The reason behind this is that by making kefir milk in the fridge, you&amp;#8217;re exposing the kefir grains to temperatures they&amp;#8217;re not very comfortable with. Therefore, make sure you don&amp;#8217;t let your grains die and if you&amp;#8217;re using the fridge approach, let them out at room temperature every now and then.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The fifth thing has to do with fermentation times. Keep in mind the following &lt;strong&gt;blanket rule&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;kefir is drinkable at any fermentation stage&lt;/strong&gt;. This means that if you forgot your kefir and left it fermenting too long, you &lt;strong&gt;don&amp;#8217;t have to throw it away&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s still good although you will notice the flavor will become somewhat sourish. At some points you may also feel the aroma of fresh yeast, &lt;strong&gt;which is perfectly normal&lt;/strong&gt;. Normally if you have more or less the right amount of grains per quantity of milk, it will take the grains around 24 hours to turn the milk into kefir milk. Still, sometimes we have too many grains and it will take a little shorter to accomplish the same. That&amp;#8217;s perfectly fine and the best way of knowing whether kefir is ready is to just look at it and shake the jar a little bit! If it looks creamy or already solid, your kefir is probably ready. It&amp;#8217;s also perfectly fine (and I recommend it) to stir the kefir milk around half way through (~12h mark) the process. This will make sure the grains circulate around the milk and get in contact with fresh milk that&amp;#8217;s not yet kefir.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  And that&amp;#8217;s it! These five items are the major things you should know about kefir. There&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;one last thing&lt;/strong&gt; I would like to mention and that is the type of milk that you use. I &lt;strong&gt;strongly recommend&lt;/strong&gt; that you use non-skim milk (in het Nederlands: volle melk). In my experience, the skimmed milk is just not as creamy and the results are not as good as full fat milk. My grains (in case you got your kefir from me) are also &lt;strong&gt;ALWAYS&lt;/strong&gt; fermented in biologic full fat fresh milk from Campina. The biologic thing is not a requirement but I like to think the kefir grains are happier in milk made by happier cows!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  That&amp;#8217;s it for this post! If you do have any questions, feel free to message me on Facebook, drop me a comment or just e-mail me! Whatever works for you!

        <title>Would you like some Kefir? Like some what?!</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Not long ago my father had mentioned this thing called &amp;#8216;kefir&amp;#8217; with which you could apparently make yoghurt. At the time I didn&amp;#8217;t pay much attention and he, despite mentioning that this kefir thing could be obtained for free (or just by paying postage), didn&amp;#8217;t make much of it either. It was not until recently, when I travelled to Russia (where it is very popular) that I finally got in close contact with &amp;#8216;kefir&amp;#8217;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Read on to learn more about kefir.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So what is kefir, really?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &amp;#8216;Kefir&amp;#8217; is often used to refer to one of two things: either the &lt;em&gt;grains&lt;/em&gt; that make kefir &lt;em&gt;milk&lt;/em&gt; or the kefir milk itself. The grains look very much like tapioca pearls that have been soaked in water. They are spongy, clump together, but they have a massive difference from tapioca pearls: &lt;em&gt;they&amp;#8217;re alive!&lt;/em&gt; No seriously, kefir grains are simply clumps of symbiotic colonies composed of yeasts and bacterias. That doesn&amp;#8217;t sound very inviting, does it!&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_619&quot; style=&quot;width: 338px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-619&quot; alt=&quot;Kefir grains&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Kefirpilze.jpg&quot; width=&quot;328&quot; height=&quot;218&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_618&quot; style=&quot;width: 330px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Kefir03.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[613]&quot; title=&quot;Would you like some Kefir? Like some what?!&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-618&quot; alt=&quot;Kefir milk&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Kefir03.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Finished kefir milk
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  But it is! After spending a few days in Russia and finding kefir milk in almost every restaurant (and drinking it with almost every meal), it started growing in me (pun totally and shamefully intended!). When I came back I decided to investigate what was kefir. What I found out was a barrage of health benefits that are traditionally associated with it. Some people call kefir a &lt;em&gt;super probiotic drink&lt;/em&gt;. You know the off-the-shelf yoghurt that promises L. Casei Imunitass as providing you with marvelous bacteria for your intestinal tract? Well, kefir (when home made, not bought at the store) contains more than &lt;em&gt;SEVENTY&lt;/em&gt; different strains of beneficial bacteria for your intestines. Are you sold yet? I was, after the &lt;em&gt;SEVENTY&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Now comes the best part. Like I mentioned in the very beginning of this post, kefir can be obtained for &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt;. Now, that&amp;#8217;s not the kefir &lt;em&gt;milk&lt;/em&gt; but the &lt;em&gt;grains&lt;/em&gt; that ferment fresh milk into &lt;em&gt;kefir milk&lt;/em&gt;. These grains are given away for free by some people because as soon as you start making kefir &lt;em&gt;milk&lt;/em&gt; daily, the grains will start growing like there&amp;#8217;s no tomorrow. Yes! The grains grow in size!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  How do I get it?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After obtaining a small mother colony off Marktplaats for a mere 1 euro plus 1 euro postage, I&amp;#8217;ve started making it and drinking it every day. My only problem right now? I have too many kefir grains! Would you like some? Then please drop me a comment with your e-mail address and I&amp;#8217;ll be in touch!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Want to learn more?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I could spend a whole day writing about how to ferment your kefir milk and discussing best and worst techniques but all of that would be in vain. All of this information can be found on what&amp;#8217;s the most comprehensive guide to kefir: &lt;a href=&quot;http://users.sa.chariot.net.au/~dna/kefirpage.html&quot;&gt;Dom&amp;#8217;s website&lt;/a&gt;. He describes in detail what kefir is and how to successfully ferment your milk (and water and coconut milk!) with your kefir grains. Be sure to visit his website as it is the reference to anyone who aspires to make his own kefir!

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href=&quot;http://getpebble.com/&quot;&gt;Pebble smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; is becoming more and more mainstream, so is the need for supporting a wider range of messaging applications. While much of the Western world does not know about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wechat.com/&quot;&gt;WeChat&lt;/a&gt;, surely everyone has at some point or another heard of WhatsApp or Blackberry Messenger. Well, WeChat is very much the same thing but it’s the most popular mobile instant messaging chat in China with over &lt;strong&gt;300 million users&lt;/strong&gt;! The single one feature that makes WeChat unique is having a walkie-talkie feature in its very core. At the literal push and release of a single button, WeChat users can send voice messages to each other, thus avoiding all the trouble of typing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because WeChat is popular in China, it is bound to push notifications which include Chinese characters. These characters are currently not supported in the Pebble (it uses Unicode for character encoding but due to space restriction it does not include fonts for characters beyond the Latin alphabet) and WeChat Pebble also takes this issue out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding a font with 2000~3000 characters seems to be troublesome due to severe space restrictions in the Pebble firmware. Therefore, I came up with an approach which makes use of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://unifoundry.com/unifont.html&quot;&gt;Unifont character library&lt;/a&gt; to render messages on the Android app and send them to the Pebble watch as a bitmap. This effectively solves the problem not only for Chinese but also for Russian, Hebrew, you name it!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-07-31-13.57.36.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[595]&quot; title=&quot;WeChat Pebble - WeChat notifications on your Pebble!&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-600&quot; alt=&quot;WeChat Pebble in action!&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-07-31-13.57.36.jpg&quot; width=&quot;277&quot; height=&quot;368&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    WeChat Pebble in action!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is available as open-source and for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you are a developer&lt;/strong&gt;, read past the installation steps for some hardcore open-source goodies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you just want to use this&lt;/strong&gt; and don’t care about the source code, just read the following two simple steps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 16px;&quot;&gt;1 – Install the Android app available in the Play Store &lt;a href=&quot;http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.espinhasoftware.wechatpebble&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or by scanning the QR code below.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE: &lt;/strong&gt;For the app to actually push the WeChat notifications you have to first start the app and follow the instructions. Also keep in mind that in the Settings you can choose different types of notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_596&quot; style=&quot;width: 178px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/market.png&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[595]&quot; title=&quot;WeChat Pebble - WeChat notifications on your Pebble!&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-596&quot; alt=&quot;Play Store&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/market.png&quot; width=&quot;168&quot; height=&quot;168&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Play Store
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 16px;&quot;&gt;(N.B. If for some reason you cannot access the Android Play Store, the .apk is also available directly from my website by clicking &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wechatpebble/WeChatPebble.apk&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 – Install the Pebble watchapp by installing this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wechatpebble/watchface.pbw&quot;&gt;.pbw&lt;/a&gt; or by scanning the QR code below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_597&quot; style=&quot;width: 178px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/watchapp.png&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[595]&quot; title=&quot;WeChat Pebble - WeChat notifications on your Pebble!&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-597&quot; alt=&quot;Pebble Watch App (.pbw)&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/watchapp.png&quot; width=&quot;168&quot; height=&quot;168&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Pebble Watch App (.pbw)
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this you’re pretty much done! Just enjoy and feel free to drop me a comment below or visit the Pebble forums’ &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/6719/working-full-unicode-font-support-in-the-pebble&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;! I will keep updating this post with news on the WeChat Pebble app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source code is available for free on GitHub: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/etiago/WeChatPebble&quot;&gt;https://github.com/etiago/WeChatPebble&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Now running off a Raspberry Pi!</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  During my recent trip to the UK I indulged myself in buying a Raspberry Pi. There&amp;#8217;s just so many things you can do with one that my initial plan of having it as an XMBC media center in our living room was quickly subdued by the rush to run my blog off it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Lo and behold! Here it is!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This blog now proudly runs off the Raspberry Pi in the photo below. Neat, hey?!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_592&quot; style=&quot;width: 433px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-12-11.26.22.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[589]&quot; title=&quot;Now running off a Raspberry Pi!&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-592&quot; alt=&quot;The mint plant in the background goes hand in hand with the RPi&#39;s green nature at only 3.5W input!&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-12-11.26.22.jpg&quot; width=&quot;423&quot; height=&quot;317&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    The mint plant in the background goes hand in hand with the RPi&amp;#8217;s green nature at only 3.5W input!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  My next plan, with the money I&amp;#8217;ll save from not paying for hosting, is to buy at least one more (I actually want to buy &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; more but shh! Don&amp;#8217;t tell my wife!) to serve as my own personal mail server. With the free version of Google Apps going the way of dinosaurs and even though current users can still use the service, it&amp;#8217;s pretty clear we&amp;#8217;re second class customers and rather than waiting until we&amp;#8217;re pushed to pay, I&amp;#8217;d rather be more proactive and switch on my own timing. In all honesty, after the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/10/4608664/lavabit-founder-closed-his-secure-email-service-to-protect-the&quot;&gt;recent news on Lavabit&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#8217;m starting to grow more and more afraid of having my private data based off US servers, so Raspberry Pis it is!
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Silicon Valley and Mozilla (or The Story of How I started Using Firefox Again)</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  My blog writing continues being as sporadic as sporadic can be, and it kind of saddens me because writing still is very much a passion for me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This time I come to you, my readers, with an exciting trip I recently took to Silicon Valley with a group of entrepreneurs from Delft&amp;#8217;s University of Technology. In this trip I had the opportunity of meeting many different interesting people from all walks of life. People with different life experiences that ranged from an ex-con to people who had successfully started their own tech company. Amongst all these people, there was one that really stood out for me, and that was &lt;a href=&quot;http://finette.com/&quot;&gt;Pascal Finette&lt;/a&gt; who you might or not know. Pascal is &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; at Mozilla. To be frank, I didn&amp;#8217;t actually get what&amp;#8217;s his official position but in the grand scheme of things, it didn&amp;#8217;t really matter. As a matter of fact, I think that&amp;#8217;s part of the take home message from the presentation Pascal gave us. What you do matters much more than what you say.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  In many ways, Pascal&amp;#8217;s talk was inspiring. Somehow I had this prejudice that Mozilla (and Firefox, more specifically) was a dying brand/company, but this view changed as soon as I stepped into their offices in Silicon Valley and started hearing about their core values. Many a times we hear the cliche &amp;#8220;there&amp;#8217;s no free lunch&amp;#8221;, but if there is such a thing as &lt;em&gt;free lunch&lt;/em&gt;, then that&amp;#8217;s what Mozilla is doing for us and they&amp;#8217;re doing it for the sake of it. Truly for free. Looking at what Mozilla does from a truly objective perspective, it kinda feels like Mozilla is the Mother Theresa of the software world. And don&amp;#8217;t take me wrong, there are many such companies out there, but Mozilla in particular inspires me for how they defined their core values and for how they juggle so well their position as a company that needs to be kept financially afloat and as an ultimately open-source organization which relies (as far as I understand) solely on no one but themselves and a bunch of people who contribute with labor and money.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;m an open-source advocate, but that doesn&amp;#8217;t mean I&amp;#8217;m an open-source monkey. I&amp;#8217;m that kind of guy who knows the value of open-source but not the kind of guy who uses open-source exclusively just because it&amp;#8217;s open and free. Open-source is great and many open-source projects stand shoulder to shoulder with their paid counterparts but for many things still, the paid alternatives are just better. Being a contributor to open-source &lt;a href=&quot;http://db.apache.org/whoweare.html&quot;&gt;myself &lt;/a&gt;I&amp;#8217;m able to see the value in it while at the same time realizing that sometimes, you just have to pay to have software that makes your life easier (e.g. give me Photoshop over Gimp, anytime).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  There&amp;#8217;s also a long standing &amp;#8220;joke&amp;#8221; in the open-source world, in that most non-tech people actually don&amp;#8217;t know what&amp;#8217;s open-source. They don&amp;#8217;t know the difference between free and &amp;#8220;libre&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;libre&amp;#8221;, being a Spanish word for the &lt;em&gt;other kind of free&lt;/em&gt; which seemingly the English language cannot describe, became famous for its inclusion in the name LibreOffice &amp;#8211; a branch of OpenOffice that&amp;#8217;s, well, truly open, free and libre).  Naturally, many people would describe Chrome as free, or Facebook even. What they don&amp;#8217;t know is that whenever they use either of these products, they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; paying with one of their most precious possessions: their privacy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I don&amp;#8217;t want to get into legal trouble here, and for the most part I like to think of Google as mostly benevolent (but a corporation nonetheless). However, if you truly want to stick it to the man and use something that is pure free and no strings attached to any corporation that makes money off you, go Mozilla; go Firefox. The browser is not worse than Chrome, and this is the story of how they conquered me back. Through one talk by Pascal Finette.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>libgdx and Vector2 mutability</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Here&amp;#8217;s a quick post to rant about something that&amp;#8217;s been affecting me for the last couple of days.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Recently I find myself toying around with libgdx to work on a game that I&amp;#8217;ve been meaning to develop for a while. The problem with this library is that apparently, all Vector2 functions affect the actual vector on which they are invoked. This goes against the Java standard of immutability for non-primitive types and is incredibly annoying, especially because these functions will also return the vector for chaining.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Why is this annoying? Well, when you&amp;#8217;re used to the Java standard, you don&amp;#8217;t expect any functions to affect the actual object. Think for example about Java&amp;#8217;s String.split. This will never affect the String itself, especially because the String is immutable. Affecting the String would mean creating a new instance of that string with the change applied to it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Frankly, I&amp;#8217;m not sure what happens in the backstage but this stinks.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Turmeric SOA &amp;#8211; Lessons learned</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  As soon as I picked up on Turmeric SOA as the engine that powers my research, one of my supervisors warned me: be careful, or you&amp;#8217;ll be caught in technology hell. As much as I hate to admit it, this has inevitably happened. The point is&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m using Turmeric SOA which is open-source and open-source is great for research. Everything is so open that I can afford to publish literally everything I do. This means that all the claims I make with my research can be easily verified independently by other researchers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I love this transparency.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The problem comes when the transparency is the result of emptiness. More specifically, Turmeric SOA is open but its documentation lacks vastly. In the inception of its open-sourcing by Intalio, Inc. their software engineers were working night and day to adapt the wiki pages (which apparently are the only public form of documentation) from mentioning &amp;#8220;EBAY&amp;#8221; to mentioning &amp;#8220;TURMERIC&amp;#8221;. However, as the dust began to settle and eBay decided to go in-house with the open-sourcing, the work done on Turmeric SOA has greatly diminished and what once was a promising open project is now a graveyard. eBay&amp;#8217;s software engineers keep a low key and aren&amp;#8217;t exactly supportive of other people using Turmeric SOA which is very disappointing. It seems common sense that if a project is open-sourced, the main goal should be for it to get a large user-base. The more people contributing and using a piece of software, the more ideas and bugs will be found and thus, the more refined the project will become.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This has not happened. As an outsider, eBay&amp;#8217;s stance on open-source seems that of a beach-goer who&amp;#8217;s too afraid to go for a dive and instead just keeps probing the water with their toes. This is bad. It&amp;#8217;s bad for eBay because it will inevitably taint their reputation with open-source, it&amp;#8217;s bad for the community who now get a half-baked services platform and it&amp;#8217;s bad more specifically for me. Now I have to deal with a promising but ultimately difficult to use platform. Most everything I do with Turmeric SOA requires copious amounts of manual debugging in order to figure out what&amp;#8217;s happening and ultimately, these debugging sessions reveal that what was advertised as a feature, really isn&amp;#8217;t one.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  In sum, the lesson learned is: be wary of large open-source projects. Unless there is a strong community around it, you&amp;#8217;re gonna have a real tough time.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The cross-discipline conundrum (or how we can&amp;#8217;t always learn from other disciplines)</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I was cycling home one day and this thought popped into my mind: I&amp;#8217;m trying to address the issues of multi-tenancy in software systems. In other words, that is to say that I&amp;#8217;m trying to make it easier for several software systems to co-exist, as tenants, in the same piece of hardware. When we think about it from a software perspective, it is definitely novel &amp;#8211; big names out there like Microsoft, VMWare, Salesforce, etc are working hard on this (each in their own way of course) and it&amp;#8217;s a rather hot topic. Companies provide their employees with Microsoft Azure training and there&amp;#8217;s this growing need to fit more (tenants) in less (hardware). Come to think of it, it&amp;#8217;s a bit like what&amp;#8217;s happening in big cities all over the world.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Wait a minute.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;That&amp;#8217;s exactly what&amp;#8217;s happening in big cities all over the world!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  And why does this matter, you ask. Well, we&amp;#8217;ve been doing this with people and cities for the best part of a century, so maybe some of the problems we face in software have already been dealt with in the &amp;#8220;physical world&amp;#8221;. &amp;#8220;Sure, Tiago, that&amp;#8217;s obvious! Why are you still writing this blog post and not out there reading books on urbanization?&amp;#8221;. Yeah, yeah, yeah&amp;#8230; have you read the title of the post? How we &lt;strong&gt;can&amp;#8217;t&lt;/strong&gt; always learn from other disciplines.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Multi-tenancy in software engineering presents its own challenges. How can you compare the concept of software versioning to any concept of the physical world? Same goes for concepts like deploying several instances of the same piece of software in different servers. Surely we can&amp;#8217;t deploy the same person across several buildings (well, quantum physics says we can, but let&amp;#8217;s stick to classical mechanics for the purpose of this post) and we definitely don&amp;#8217;t want to have a tenant with a bathroom on one street, the bedroom two blocks away and finally the living room in a different town. That doesn&amp;#8217;t work for people, it&amp;#8217;s not convenient, but it works for software. Software doesn&amp;#8217;t care if it has to invoke method foo() in its own memory stack or if it has to wrap its request in SOAP and have it traverse all over the world to have it executed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So what&amp;#8217;s the point of this post, really? While it&amp;#8217;s always good to have a broad cross-disciplinary view and keep an open mind and an eye out for other fields which might be (metaphorically) solving the same problems as yourself, it&amp;#8217;s also very important to identify genuine problems in your field. Sure, resorting to metaphors is perfect to learn from other fields but these don&amp;#8217;t always apply perfectly and when they don&amp;#8217;t apply perfectly, my theory is that they are no good.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  In other news, I just submitted my paper to WCRE 2012 🙂 let&amp;#8217;s see how convincing am I with my maintenance techniques for distributed systems&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Changing the way I use my Mac</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I never thought I would come to write such a post one day, but the truth of the matter is: the way I used to use my computer wasn&amp;#8217;t sustainable. Whoa! It seems you really can use the word sustainable wherever you want&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;m a browser person. Pretty much everything I do sits inside the browser: e-mails, RSS feeds, reading the news, facebook, etc&amp;#8230; everything happens inside the browser. When I need to find a scientific paper, what do I do? That&amp;#8217;s right! I use my browser to go to Google Scholar where I then search for what I&amp;#8217;m looking for. Nowadays I&amp;#8217;m even having some Google Docs action ever since I started sharing documents with my fiancée which require the capability of simultaneous collaborative editing. Sadly, all of this can only happen in the browser. Microsoft, with all its might, still hasn&amp;#8217;t figured out a way to make Microsoft Office collaborative. But I digress.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The point is, those of you who are lazy and like to keep things at hand (like me), probably end up with at least 10 tabs open at all time. And your work flow is something like &amp;#8220;open tab&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;search for something&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;close tab&amp;#8221; and that would be peachy if it wasn&amp;#8217;t for all the &lt;del&gt;bugs&lt;/del&gt; features present in nowadays&amp;#8217; browsers. For example, if you close a tab in Chrome, Chrome will still keep that tab stored just in case you made a mistake and want to bring it back to life. Similarly, all your path within a tab is stored, in case you want to push the back button to go to where you where before. Now, when you put these two together (a whole path plus saving all the closed tabs), this brings up quite a massive memory requirement. In the beginning it might not be noticeable, but Chrome (and Firefox, Safari, etc) can grow above 1Gb of memory quite fast.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  When that happens, your computer will start swapping memory to the hard-drive and eventually you&amp;#8217;ll start to feel sluggishness in everything you do.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  How can I fix that? This was my first thought. And if I can&amp;#8217;t drive web-browser developers to do something about it and truly make their code more memory friendly, that means I have to change the way I use my Mac. It started with GMail. I&amp;#8217;m an avid GMail user but GMail&amp;#8217;s web interface is loaded with resource-hogging javascript. This meant that GMail had to go and give way to a more resource friendly Thunderbird. A purpose-built application which, despite only serving one task, it&amp;#8217;s always there whenever I need it. It also notifies me whenever I receive a new e-mail and I can even replace Outlook which I was using for my university e-mail! Something about two birds and a stone comes to mind&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Not requiring to have my e-mail open in the browser anymore, this meant I could just close the browser whenever I don&amp;#8217;t need it. This has been the biggest change in my behavior. Nowadays, I open the browser, check whatever I want to check, and afterwards, the way of the dinosaurs it goes again. This means that the memory usage of the browser never goes up like mad anymore, my computer is always snappy and all the frustration of dealing with a slow as molasses computer is gone.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Nota bene, I have 8Gb of RAM in my Mac, I&amp;#8217;ve had it this way for a while now, and if history has taught me anything, that is that no amount of RAM is enough when you use the browser continuously, without ever closing it or restarting your computer. Period.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Lesson learned? How happy you feel about your computer&amp;#8217;s speed has a strong correlation (and causation) with how often you close your browser.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>[Quickies] Why can&amp;#8217;t I move (certain) applications to the SD card?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Following up on the previous “quickies” format, I decided to answer a question that goes unanswered through a quick Google search. This quickie has to do with the &lt;em&gt;Android OS&lt;/em&gt; platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;: Why can’t I move certain applications to the SD card?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/strong&gt;: The “move to SD card” feature of Android MUST be explicitly enabled by the developers of each application. This is the reason why for some apps, the “move to SD card” button is greyed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps anyone who’s ever asked Google this question!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>[Quickies] Galaxy S2 MIUI 1.12.30 Camera Force Closes</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;ve tagged this post as a &amp;#8220;quickie&amp;#8221; as I just want to share the solution to a problem I&amp;#8217;ve been having with my recently bought Galaxy S2. This solution was found indirectly and from my extensive search through the Internet, I haven&amp;#8217;t found anyone describing either this problem or the solution to it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Problem&lt;/strong&gt;: When using the MIUI 1.12.30 ROM on the Samsung Galaxy S2, the camera will freeze and eventually force close while attempting to record video.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: The solution to this problem is so simple that &amp;#8220;it hurts&amp;#8221;. If you&amp;#8217;re running MIUI, your kernel will most certainly have the ClockworkMod (CWM) flashed onto it. You will have to go into CWM (i.e. Shutdown phone then power it up with the combo Volume Up + Power + Home), then into the &amp;#8220;advanced&amp;#8221; menu and choose the &amp;#8220;fix permissions&amp;#8221; option.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After you&amp;#8217;ve done this, reboot the phone et voilà! It&amp;#8217;s really that easy!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;ve found this &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.cyanogenmod.com/topic/32601-camera-keeps-force-closing/page__p__278856__hl__camera__fromsearch__1&quot;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt; through having a similar problem in CyanogenMod. In their forums they explain how to fix it for CM7.1 so I decided to give it a try on MIUI. Turns out the problem is the same.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Hope this saved you some time!
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WSO2 PHP&amp;#8217;s WSF Library (or whatever the damn it is called&amp;#8230;) and Turmeric SOA</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/762791717WSO2pic.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[519]&quot; title=&quot;762791717WSO2pic&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-523&quot; title=&quot;762791717WSO2pic&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/762791717WSO2pic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;102&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The title of this post is verbose enough about the feelings I have regarding the naming of this library. It&amp;#8217;s as if WSO2 took a page from Microsoft&amp;#8217;s book regarding names. What&amp;#8217;s next? A Home Edition? Maybe throw in Professional, Business and Ultimate versions too for good measure.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Don&amp;#8217;t take me wrong, I have no special feelings towards names themselves, it&amp;#8217;s just how difficult it makes to search for people working on the same things and facing the same problems. What do I Google for? WSO2? WSF? PHP? Any combination of these? It&amp;#8217;s only made worse by these guys developing frameworks in several platforms, which means I end up finding completely unrelated results from a different implementation, in a different technology.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  But, naming rants aside, I thought it would be a good idea to share my experience with getting this library up and running on PHP. I came across this library when converting Apache Stonehenge&amp;#8217;s web application to use Turmeric&amp;#8217;s instances of Stonehenge&amp;#8217;s web services, and it gave me quite some headaches. For this reason, and so that other people in the future don&amp;#8217;t have to go through the same painful experiences, I decided to write this blog post. Keep reading if I got your attention&amp;#8230;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  First and foremost, I should warn that I&amp;#8217;m also gonna write the Linux walkthrough and it does expect you to have some basic Linux knowledge. Nothing too advanced, you just need to know your way around a Linux system in a command line. If you meet this criterion, this walkthrough should be a walk in the park (no pun intended there).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Setting up the library
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  To begin with, you must download the WSF PHP library &lt;strong&gt;sources&lt;/strong&gt;. You should be able to find it &lt;a href=&quot;http://wso2.com/products/web-services-framework/php/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; somewhere. At the time of writing, the latest version is 2.1.0. Make sure you download the &lt;strong&gt;sources&lt;/strong&gt;. Sadly, the binaries only include DLL&amp;#8217;s for the Windows installation, which means that us, Linux users, must compile our own binaries by hand. No biggie though, it&amp;#8217;s easier than it sounds.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After you&amp;#8217;ve downloaded the library, the next thing you should do is &amp;#8220;cd&amp;#8221; into the directory. Then, normally you&amp;#8217;d just do ./configure followed by a make and make install, but there&amp;#8217;s a caveat: it&amp;#8217;s VERY recommended that you specify a prefix when you do ./configure. The prefix will tell WSO2 where to place the binaries after you compile and &amp;#8220;install&amp;#8221;, and this is extremely useful for WSF as you&amp;#8217;ll need a clean directory featuring only the binary files of this library. You&amp;#8217;ll understand why in a minute.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  In sum, you should do:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;./configure --prefix=/usr/local/bin/apache2/php/wsf-php/
 make
 [sudo] make install&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  In my example you&amp;#8217;ll see that I&amp;#8217;m telling &amp;#8220;make&amp;#8221; to install the library in /usr/local/bin/apache2/php/wsf-php/ and in the last step I&amp;#8217;ve also accounted for those of you who, like me, use Ubuntu. If you use Ubuntu, make sure you add the sudo before the make install command (without brackets).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Troubleshooting: &lt;/strong&gt;If you installed PHP through Ubuntu&amp;#8217;s packages, it is possible that everything went fine at this point. If it did (i.e. if you got no errors in neither of the stages) then excellent. Move on. Skip this section. If, on the other hand, you got an error about a missing php-config, then you need to specify the path to this binary in the ./configure step. First you should know where your PHP installation lies (and you&amp;#8217;re entirely on your own for this one) and once you know where it is, your php-config binary is inside &lt;path_to_php&gt;/bin/. Once you figured out where that is, you should go back to those three steps above, except your ./configure should look like:
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;gt; &lt;pre&gt;./configure --prefix=/usr/local/bin/apache2/php/wsf-php/ --with-php-config=&amp;lt;path_to_php&amp;gt;/bin/php-config&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After this, don&amp;#8217;t forget of course, to do the make and make install steps.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  With that done, you should now have the compiled library in /usr/local/bin/apache2/php/wsf/ (or in whichever folder you specified as prefix). You also want to have a look at the final lines of the &amp;#8220;make install&amp;#8221; step and look for a reference to a wsf.so file. That&amp;#8217;s THE library that PHP will load and you&amp;#8217;ll need to know exactly where it is. In my case, the library sits in /usr/local/bin/apache2/php/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20090626/wsf.so . My guess is that the make install step is smart enough to put it in the equivalent folder inside your PHP&amp;#8217;s installation. Anyhow, copy this directory.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The next step involves editing your php.ini file. Again, you should know where this is. After you found it, add the following lines to it:
&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;gt; &lt;pre&gt;extension=/usr/local/bin/apache2/php/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20090626/wsf.so
wsf.home=&quot;/usr/local/bin/apache2/php/wsf-php/&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  From that you can see that I put the path to the .so file as an extension that PHP must load, and I specified an entry called &amp;#8220;wsf.home&amp;#8221; that will tell WSF where its &amp;#8220;auxiliary&amp;#8221; files are. This is the path you used as the prefix during the compiling process. These are the two most essential parameters that need to be configured to get WSF up and running, there&amp;#8217;s more but I&amp;#8217;m aiming at the quickest way possible to get it running, with as little configuration as possible.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After you&amp;#8217;ve added those lines, you should restart your Apache et voilà! Your PHP installation should now have loaded the WSF library. If you want to be sure that everything is up and running, you can check the contents of /tmp/wsf_php_server.log . If everything went well, this log should have no errors.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Creating a client and using it
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Now comes another &lt;strong&gt;tricky part&lt;/strong&gt;. Great, now your library is up and running, but how do you &lt;strong&gt;use it&lt;/strong&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;m gonna provide another quick and simple explanation of how to get a client up and running for an existing service. This assumes, of course, that you already have a service running somewhere which provides you with a WSDL file and SOAP ports that you can invoke.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Provided you have that, you need to copy a folder in the WSF sources to somewhere safe and accessible by PHP (by accessible, I mean, PHP/Apache should have at least read and execute permissions). The folder you need is &lt;WSF_sources&gt;/scripts/. Copy it somewhere you know it won&amp;#8217;t get deleted by an overzealous system administrator and keep it accessible. I would keep it out of public access via Apache but that&amp;#8217;s entirely up to you. It&amp;#8217;s the next step that is &lt;strong&gt;important&lt;/strong&gt;.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Now that you copied this folder (and all its contents) to somewhere safe, you need to go back to your php.ini and add the folder to its include_path definition. In my case, I just uncommented the already existing line and added my scripts folder to it. In the end it looked like:
&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;gt; &lt;pre&gt;include_path = &quot;.:/php/includes:/usr/local/bin/apache2/php/scripts/&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After you&amp;#8217;ve added/uncommented this line, be sure to restart Apache once more. This line will just tell PHP where it can find scripts that WSF will need whenever you&amp;#8217;re using its libraries.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  With that out of the way, the next step consists of creating a PHP classmap of all the operations and types you have in your WSDL file. My advice is that you obtain the WSDL file in advance and store it somewhere in your hard-drive. After you&amp;#8217;ve done this, just go to the scripts folder and do:
&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;gt; &lt;pre&gt;php wsdl2php.php &amp;lt;path_to_your_wsdl_file&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  It can happen at this step that Linux will tell you it can&amp;#8217;t find PHP. If that&amp;#8217;s the case, instead of starting off with just &amp;#8220;php&amp;#8221;, use the full path instead.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  By doing this step, you&amp;#8217;ll see a bunch of PHP code scrolling through your console. If that was the case, repeat the command and redirect the output to a file, e.g. &amp;gt; somefile.php.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This somefile.php is now your client. It includes a PHP class for every type in your WSDL and an action for every SOAP port. It also includes, at the very end, a sample of how you&amp;#8217;d invoke every action. By looking at that you can probably get a good idea of how WSF works, and that&amp;#8217;s pretty much it. I assume that if you&amp;#8217;re messing around with PHP, you do have enough knowledge to get rid of these sample invokations and just use this file as something you import and use in your PHP application. That&amp;#8217;s not going to be covered in this tutorial.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  If you do have questions or ran into trouble while following these steps, please do leave me a comment and I&amp;#8217;ll try to answer as soon as possible. I hope this has somehow helped you, reader. I know I wish I had found something like this post when I first started messing around with WSF!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Till the next post!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/WSF_sources&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/path_to_php&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Black and white icons for Caffeine</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This is gonna be a quick and short post about a tool I use on my Mac called &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/&quot;&gt;Caffeine&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;. This tool essentially allows me, at the click of a button, to disable the display&amp;#8217;s dim and eventual turn off function. It&amp;#8217;s useful when you&amp;#8217;re reading something and you won&amp;#8217;t be touching the keyboard or the mouse, but you&amp;#8217;d still like the screen to be on. It&amp;#8217;s useful also when I&amp;#8217;m playing along a guitar tab and I can&amp;#8217;t afford to stop playing just to get the screen back on.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Anyway, this tool places an icon on the status bar. The only problem is that this icon is in color and it just stands out in my status bar like a sore thumb. SO! I created a new icon set. You can get it by clicking &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/icons.zip&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Scroll down to have a look at the icons before you download it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  All you have to do is copy them to &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-family: Consolas, Monaco, monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre;&quot;&gt;/Applications/Caffeine.app/Contents/Resources/ &lt;/span&gt;et voilà! I&amp;#8217;ve included two more icons (not shown here) for the right click behavior.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Icons:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/active.png&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[505]&quot; title=&quot;active&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-507&quot; title=&quot;active&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/active.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;22&quot; height=&quot;20&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/inactive.png&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[505]&quot; title=&quot;inactive&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-508&quot; title=&quot;inactive&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/inactive.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;22&quot; height=&quot;20&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    This is what it looks like in action:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-11-at-8.40.20-PM.png&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[505]&quot; title=&quot;Screen Shot 2011-09-11 at 8.40.20 PM&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-509&quot; title=&quot;Screen Shot 2011-09-11 at 8.40.20 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-11-at-8.40.20-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;562&quot; height=&quot;22&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    and&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-11-at-8.40.48-PM.png&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[505]&quot; title=&quot;Screen Shot 2011-09-11 at 8.40.48 PM&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-510&quot; title=&quot;Screen Shot 2011-09-11 at 8.40.48 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-11-at-8.40.48-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;562&quot; height=&quot;21&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

        <title>On Turmeric SOA, open-source and the Apache Software Foundation</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Service-Oriented-Architecture-SOA-For-Dummies.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[490]&quot; title=&quot;Service Oriented Architecture SOA For Dummies&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-496&quot; title=&quot;Service Oriented Architecture SOA For Dummies&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Service-Oriented-Architecture-SOA-For-Dummies.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;194&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a while since I posted something on this blog, partly due to my laziness, but also due to a chronic lack of time and patience to come home after an intellectually intense day of work and still have the peace of mind to gather my thoughts and put them in words. Today was, luckily, one of those days. Not because it was a particularly easy day at work (reengineering someone else&amp;#8217;s code with little to non-existing documentation is &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; an easy job) but perhaps the intense gym session loosed my brains just enough for organized and coherent thought to just happen. In any case, I digress.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This post has three main themes. I will be talking about a platform for SOA applications called Turmeric (funny name, I know. I&amp;#8217;m using for SOA the same I use in my lentil soup), open-source in general and finally, the Apache Software Foundation and some recent events I&amp;#8217;ve been involved in.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I shall begin with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebayopensource.org/index.php/Turmeric/HomePage&quot;&gt;Turmeric SOA&lt;/a&gt;. Turmeric SOA, despite the strange choice of name, is actually an industry grade platform for web services. Why is it industry grade, you ask? Is it because the developers so claim? Not really. The industry grade designation is actually made by me &amp;#8211; the project (and its developers) do not claim anything about it being industry ready or anything of that kind. I should mention, however, that Turmeric SOA is the &lt;strong&gt;open-source&lt;/strong&gt; version of the platform that powers eBay. Yes, you read that right, THE eBay. In my book, if a platform handles the millions of customers all over the world that eBay does, that platform is pretty much as industry-grade as it gets these days.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Why am I talking about Turmeric SOA? Why am I even involved in Turmeric SOA?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  It&amp;#8217;s very simple really and it all points back to my work as a Ph.D. student at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/~tiago/&quot;&gt;Delft University of Technology&lt;/a&gt;. My research, in broad terms consists of analyzing and coming up with new ways of helping the maintenance, reengineering and testing of Service Oriented Architectures. In this description, I&amp;#8217;ve cleverly omitted the keyword that defines my research, mostly because it&amp;#8217;s a vague buzzword that means different things to different people (in case you&amp;#8217;re wondering, the word is &lt;em&gt;multi-tenancy&lt;/em&gt;). In any case, my research involving SOA only makes sense if I have a software system on which I can investigate and demonstrate my claims and this is where it all gets hairy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The fact is that for most companies, SOA simply means exposing some of their data through an API built on top of SOAP or REST, et voilà. All of a sudden they can claim that they are a company of the future because they have a SOA system. This, however, couldn&amp;#8217;t be farther from what an actual SOA system should be. We can even take the etymological angle and look at what SOA means: Service Oriented &lt;strong&gt;Architecture&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve emphasized the word &amp;#8220;architecture&amp;#8221; as I believe that is the keyword in the SOA acronym. Your SOA system should be built using an architectural style consistent with that of services that communicate with each other. It should be oriented towards/based on services, and not a monolithic blob with one tiny service gateway that allows me to query some data, even if that data is provided in a platform-agnostic manner. To people who have such monolithic SOA-wannabe systems, I ask: can I slice part of your software and place it elsewhere in the world with an Internet connection on both ends? If I can&amp;#8217;t, what if your user-base or your business grow to a point where one server no longer cuts it? What do you do then? Keep buying bigger motherboards with more CPU and RAM sockets?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Let&amp;#8217;s get real here. Your software system is service-oriented if I can grab all the pieces that compose it and spread it all over the world. The only thing I should have to tell the software system is: &amp;#8220;you have service A deployed at this endpoint, service B at this other endpoint, etc etc&amp;#8221; and then it would automagically just work, regardless of whether the services are running in the same application server or in each other&amp;#8217;s antipodes in completely opposite timezones.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So why am I bringing this up? Well, as it stands it&amp;#8217;s difficult enough to find open-source systems that are truly built around a service-oriented architecture. For most of these services, SOA is an afterthought. It&amp;#8217;s something those open-source ERP developers woke up one day and thought &amp;#8220;hey, wouldn&amp;#8217;t it be cool if our ERP had some SOA features?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; and alas, the result is invariably slamming some poorly engineered JAXWS or Axis2 solution on top of already existing business logic and inevitably making a mess of a perfectly fine (albeit, poorly scaling) software system.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  From my own experience, this is the summary of most open-source ERP systems out there that claim to have some kind of SOA functionality.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This doesn&amp;#8217;t cut it for us. This is not what the SOA paradigm truly stands for and these systems are ultimately useless for my research. There&amp;#8217;s only one web service! How the hell is it supposed to communicate with anything? Its business logic is ultimately still relying on local method calls.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Then out of this hell comes another frightening fact. Even the web service platforms out there are useless on their own. I was chatting with a friend of mine &amp;#8211; who&amp;#8217;s not a computer scientist &amp;#8211; the other day, and I was struggling to explain to her what exactly my problem was without using terms such as JAXWS, Turmeric, web services or SOA. I think I came up with a clear laymen explanation involving the process of building a car. So, my problem right now is that I need a very specific type of car, say, one that is rocket propelled. There are, of course, brands out there that have rocket propelled cars but there&amp;#8217;s no way on Earth that these guys are gonna let me even LOOK at their car, set aside open the hood and disassemble its engine. Yet, my research consists of analyzing the problems and challenges of maintaining a rocket propelled car. But I have no car, and no means to get one. This is a pretty big inconvenience. Not even me promising this car brand that I won&amp;#8217;t build a competitor car, or destroy their car will convince them to let me pop the hood &amp;#8211; and so, Houston, we have a problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The solution to this problem is seemingly simple. I can just build my own rocket propelled car and hope for the best. But then we run into a more essential problem: I&amp;#8217;m not a car maker, nor does my department pay me to make cars. Also, if by the end of my Ph.D. I&amp;#8217;ve only built a rocket propelled car, they&amp;#8217;re not gonna be happy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I could also cut some corners and build a mockup of a rocket propelled car. Sure, maybe it doesn&amp;#8217;t have a gearbox and the steering wheel is made of cardboard, but hey! It&amp;#8217;s a rocket propelled car! This would be swell, if it wasn&amp;#8217;t for the fact that even the free tools I can get out there to make cars are pretty&amp;#8230; well&amp;#8230; horrible. Stepping back out of the metaphor world, the problem is that the technologies available allow me to build simple web services. I can just grab Java&amp;#8217;s Metro project (aka JAXWS) and very easily deploy a web service, but that&amp;#8217;s just what it is. A web service, accessible via SOAP, amidst nothingness. There&amp;#8217;s nothing I can query to know that this service is there, there&amp;#8217;s no platform managing this service and telling me that it has &lt;em&gt;this many&lt;/em&gt; services and that &lt;em&gt;this particular one&lt;/em&gt; is one of them, there&amp;#8217;s no statistics or runtime information being kept on this service, there&amp;#8217;s basically&amp;#8230; nothing. Just a Java class with a &amp;#8220;WebService&amp;#8221; sticker on it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  These tools make it difficult to build something that even resembles a real world SOA system (i.e. a rocket propelled car). They&amp;#8217;re the tiniest building blocks that you can think of. The sand in the car&amp;#8217;s windshield or the iron ore in the chassis&amp;#8217; stainless steel. Sure, I can melt the sand, add some caustic soda and fashion my own windshield out of it. I can melt the iron ore and through some process I don&amp;#8217;t even know, make steel. But how long is this going to take me? And will the final result be a faithful representation of what actual companies in this line of work have made? Or just a silly toy example that doesn&amp;#8217;t fully represent the pains and benefits of such a system?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/TurmericLogo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[490]&quot; title=&quot;TurmericLogo&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-498&quot; title=&quot;TurmericLogo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/TurmericLogo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;214&quot; height=&quot;117&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;That&amp;#8217;s where Turmeric comes in. My first impression when I started using Turmeric was that of confusion. I thought to myself &amp;#8220;well, that&amp;#8217;s another platform with an awful lot of features that no one&amp;#8217;s ever going to use&amp;#8221;, but I was wrong. Over time, with more thoroughly exploring this platform, it became clear that perhaps every single feature in Turmeric really stemmed from a real world use case, most likely from eBay. All those features, if you really think about it, you&amp;#8217;ll end up realizing &amp;#8220;oh yeah, they probably use this to achieve X and Y&amp;#8221;. In other words, even if we don&amp;#8217;t have the rocket propelled car, we have the exact tools that we need to build one. Knowing that if the toolset includes a door-shaped mould, it probably means that our car should have at least one door &amp;#8211; for which other reason would those guys have built such a tool if they hadn&amp;#8217;t built a door for their car before?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This makes Turmeric a very good candidate to be used as the tooling for my research. But Turmeric isn&amp;#8217;t, in my point of view, a very good candidate anymore. It&amp;#8217;s evolved from that into an &lt;strong&gt;excellent&lt;/strong&gt; candidate at that! Now it&amp;#8217;s the time when I really have to shine a light on &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the guys behind the task of open-sourcing eBay&amp;#8217;s platform. Those guys form a small community of people who usually hang around #turmeric-dev at irc.freenode.net and who just happen to be extremely friendly and helpful. Every time I hit a road bump with Turmeric, these guys go out of their ways to help me achieve the things I&amp;#8217;m trying to achieve and I think that&amp;#8217;s a lot more than I could have ever asked for.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Quickly moving to the topic of open-source, since Turmeric SOA is actually an open-source project, this made me ever so fond of open-source stuff. It&amp;#8217;s really nice to see all these people dedicated in making such a tremendous contribution that is open-sourcing a platform from eBay to the good of the community. I love that. I love being able to &amp;#8211; should I need &amp;#8211; download a relational database management system from Apache without having to pay for it. I love seeing projects like Ubuntu flourish, showing companies that even software is all about the people it&amp;#8217;s built to and with a little help, even an open-source can kick big corporations in their royal butts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  All this to say that I&amp;#8217;ve learned a whole lot over the last few days. Amongst the things I&amp;#8217;ve learned is for example, git. The cool kids&amp;#8217; versioning system. As Turmeric nowadays relies on Git for its version management, I thought now would be a good time to learn it and see what advantages it brings over SVN &amp;#8211; and boy, does it leave SVN in its rear view mirror! I&amp;#8217;ve grown so much accustomed to it that I&amp;#8217;ve started moving my projects to Git as well and I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to influence other people around me to use it (Andy, if you&amp;#8217;re reading this, wink wink, nudge nudge ;)). The saddest part of it all is that, in my opinion, you don&amp;#8217;t really fully understand the advantages it brings until you really give it a try with real source code that you must maintain in collaboration with other people.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Going on a bit of a tangent, Git (and open-source) has also enabled me to propose some enhancements to David Carver&amp;#8217;s (Turmeric SOA&amp;#8217;s top man) IRC bot that idles around #turmeric-dev &amp;#8211; all via the clever features of Github, forking and pull requesting.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/46833_425136126860_586946860_5624931_1569623_n.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[490]&quot; title=&quot;46833_425136126860_586946860_5624931_1569623_n&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-499&quot; title=&quot;46833_425136126860_586946860_5624931_1569623_n&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/46833_425136126860_586946860_5624931_1569623_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;254&quot; height=&quot;259&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;To finalize, the Apache Software Foundation. I&amp;#8217;m gonna make it short and sweet. As of a couple of days ago, my fellow open-sourcers at Apache Derby decided to vote me to become a PMC (Program Management Committee) member for the Apache DB project. I have, of course, accepted and it is a post I will do my best to honor and live up to. I started off as a Google Summer of Code student at Apache Derby, then got promoted to committership, this year I had the privilege to mentor Siddharth Srivastava and now I&amp;#8217;m becoming a PMC member. Life&amp;#8217;s good.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  It&amp;#8217;s late now, time for sleep. If you&amp;#8217;ve read it all the way down here, thank you! You&amp;#8217;re brave!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Good night!

        <title>Idea for Google/Bing</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I just had this idea that could truly revolutionize search engines. Let&amp;#8217;s start with the motivation:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/google_logo-copy1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[447]&quot; title=&quot;google_logo copy&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-455&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid black;&quot; title=&quot;google_logo copy&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/google_logo-copy1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;216&quot; height=&quot;120&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What do we usually rely on search engines for? Answer-finding, correct? We are part of a generation that mindlessly presses CTRL + T to open a new tab in our browser of choice, points it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.google.com&lt;/a&gt; and types away whatever question we need an answer for. Then comes the tedious process of sorting through all the results in hopes of truly finding the answer to what we&amp;#8217;re looking for. Typically, in a good day, we will find a link that contains the answer to our question, use the answer and ditch the browser tab. Does this sound like something you do more than once a day? Well, then read on.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  What if we could make this process better? Oftentimes, I&amp;#8217;ll require the answer to my question more than once and most of the times I just can&amp;#8217;t be bothered with bookmarking the page. Even because, most of the times, I forget that I bookmarked something and I end up going to Google to search for something I already have an answer for, buried within my bookmarks. So there&amp;#8217;s clearly a problem here. I&amp;#8217;m wasting time more than once to find answers for the same information and &amp;#8211; drawing on my recently developed and work-in-progress Dutch skills &amp;#8211; &lt;em&gt;dat kan niet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Why don&amp;#8217;t we make search engines smarter? Let&amp;#8217;s look at an example.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;m a hobbyist guitar player and every now and then, I&amp;#8217;ll go to Google and search for &amp;#8220;soldier of love tab&amp;#8221;. Then I&amp;#8217;ll search through all the guitar tab sites and I finally find that one tab that is actually well written and faithful to the original song. Brilliant. I open it, I play it by myself once, I pretend to be an epic guitarist by playing along to the MP3 of the original and I close the tab feeling proud that I can play the guitar. But then, the next weekend comes and my girlfriend comes to visit. Of course, being the romantic guy that I am, I want to play for her but damn&amp;#8230; it&amp;#8217;s going to take me long to find that really good guitar tab again and alas, the mood is killed. BUT! What if the first time around, I could have told Google &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;this link contains the exact answer for &amp;#8216;soldier of love tab&amp;#8217;&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8221; so that whenever I searched again for this (or similar, e.g. &amp;#8216;soldier of love chords&amp;#8217;) string, Google would tell me &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;hey, you&amp;#8217;ve searched for something similar before and you have previously defined answers for this question&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;. Wouldn&amp;#8217;t this be great?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Wouldn&amp;#8217;t it also be great if I could even mark specific segments of a result page as containing the answer for my question? Maybe sometimes I&amp;#8217;d search &amp;#8220;how to list &lt;a href=&quot;http://ant.apache.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ant&lt;/a&gt; targets on the command line?&amp;#8221; and I&amp;#8217;d select a specific snippet of a website where it says &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;ant -p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; as the answer to my question. Then, whenever I&amp;#8217;d search for it again, Google would give me &lt;strong&gt;THE answer&lt;/strong&gt; rather than links to &lt;strong&gt;potential answers&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Then we could get crazy with it. Make it anonymously social! &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Other users have searched for a similar question, these are the links they selected as answers&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;. Users, by adopting this technique for themselves, would be helping each other as well and soon, the millions (billions?) of people using conventional search engines could eventually turn Google from a &lt;strong&gt;result-based&lt;/strong&gt; search engine into an &lt;strong&gt;answer-based&lt;/strong&gt; one.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  We would all spend less time searching and we&amp;#8217;d all turn more productive by literally having the answers to everything we need at our fingertips.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  That was the basic gist of my idea. Please, Google or Bing engineers, if you read this, you can take this idea. For free. I claim no royalties, copyrights or trademarks&amp;#8230; but it&amp;#8217;d be pretty cool if you told me about it in case you use it. Also, in roughly 3.5 years I&amp;#8217;ll be finished with my Doctorate degree and I&amp;#8217;ll be probably looking for a job. Keep that in mind, will you? 😉
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Adobe Starts Including Spyware With Acrobat Reader</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  We all know the folks at Adobe are some really nice people and that Steve Jobs was just being a bastard by not allowing Flash on the iPhone. But as it turns out, whilst Apple is too restrictive as to what it allows on their AppStore and their iDevices, Adobe on the other hand is too permissive and they might have just crossed a line.&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Now, I understand that companies are all just trying to make money but if you attempt to install the latest Adobe Acrobat Reader and you&amp;#8217;re using Firefox, you&amp;#8217;ll be asked to install a Firefox extension to manage the download. While I typically try to avoid these downloaders (mostly because they&amp;#8217;re unnecessary and due to the fact that I don&amp;#8217;t feel comfortable with a company that thinks they&amp;#8217;re too important to give me a direct HTTP link), I was in a rush and I couldn&amp;#8217;t find a direct link on the page I was taken to. Considering this, I just thought &amp;#8220;how bad can it be?&amp;#8221; and went ahead.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  What was not my surprise when I saw the following, without ANY user input at all:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/adobespyware.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[434]&quot; title=&quot;adobespyware&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-435 alignnone&quot; title=&quot;adobespyware&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/adobespyware.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;454&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/adobespyware.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Yep, what you see there is Adobe&amp;#8217;s downloader which has just installed McAfee Security Scan Plus. Without prompting me about it AT ALL. I was pretty annoyed with this situation because if this isn&amp;#8217;t the definition of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-invasive_software&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ad/spyware&lt;/a&gt;, then I don&amp;#8217;t know what is. I just thought I&amp;#8217;d write this as I&amp;#8217;m not usually very happy with companies who think it&amp;#8217;s OK to install software on my computer without my consent. It&amp;#8217;s not OK. Adobe, you&amp;#8217;re the one McAfee should be protecting me from.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How To Seal a Bag Airtight With a Plastic Bottle</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/recycle_logo_13.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[417]&quot; title=&quot;recycle_logo_1&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-427&quot; title=&quot;recycle_logo_1&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/recycle_logo_13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;You&amp;#8217;re just about to learn a technique known for many centuries by Buddhist priests, passed on from generation to generation, but always kept in secret within their ranks. This technique teaches you how to seal a bag, in a airtight manner, with nothing but a&amp;#8230;. plastic bottle!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Yes, my description was dramatically exaggerated. This is just one of those cool DIY things that most people don&amp;#8217;t think about, but hopefully, after reading this article, you&amp;#8217;ll remember it next time you need to seal a bag.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Read on if I got your attention.&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So here&amp;#8217;s what you&amp;#8217;re going to need:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  1. Plastic bottle, any size will do.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  2. Plastic bag &amp;#8211; obviously it cannot have any holes on it or this trick won&amp;#8217;t work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  3. Pair of scissors &amp;#8211; preferably ones with sharp, pointy tips. This will make it easier for you.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After you have obtained these tools, you start by cutting the &amp;#8220;mouth&amp;#8221; of the bottle off. You have to cut a little bit under where you screw the cap, so that on one end you have the mouth-less bottle and on the other, you have just the mouth with a little bit of plastic attached to it &amp;#8211; just like on the image:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/image001.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[417]&quot; title=&quot;image001&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-420 alignnone&quot; title=&quot;image001&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/image001.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;214&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/image001.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;At this point you should have separated these two parts of the bottle and now is when the &amp;#8220;magic&amp;#8221; begins. In actual fact, you just need the mouthpiece, you can throw away the rest or fancy a vase out of it. With the mouthpiece, you unscrew the cap, pass the open part of the bag through the mouth of the bottle and apply the cap over the plastic bag, thus sealing it shut. Here&amp;#8217;s an image explaining showing the end result:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/image002.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[417]&quot; title=&quot;image002&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-421 alignnone&quot; title=&quot;image002&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/image002.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;213&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    Now you can store away your peanuts and they&amp;#8217;ll never go soggy again!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Free Storage With Dropbox (Free Online Backups)</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/dropbox.png&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[412]&quot; title=&quot;dropbox&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-413&quot; title=&quot;dropbox&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/dropbox.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;127&quot; height=&quot;127&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you need a way to store your files in a manner that they are always accessible everywhere, then Dropbox is for you. In case you haven&amp;#8217;t yet heard about this service, then know that Dropbox offers you 2Gb for free to store whichever files you like. The guys at Dropbox also have a software that integrates nicely with Windows and Mac OS and you can even access the files from your iPhone or Android powered phone.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  You might think that 2Gb are rather meager and you are right, that&amp;#8217;s nothing these days. This is why Dropbox has an awesome &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTU5NzI4OQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;referral program&lt;/a&gt; that will allow you to go up to 10Gb just by referring friends! That&amp;#8217;s right, 10Gb for free just by referring Dropbox to a few friends.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Read on to find out more!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  If you are up for it, Dropbox also offers paid plans where you can pay $9.99 a month for 50Gb of storage or you can go the extra mile and pay $19.99 for the 100Gb service. Still, if this is a little too extreme for you, register an account (with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTU5NzI4OQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my referral&lt;/a&gt;, obviously :)) and start spamming referring friends with your link!
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Android Rooting For Dummies (What is Rooting?)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-410&quot; title=&quot;root Android&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/root-Android.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  One of the things I had a hard trouble finding an answer for after I got my first Android phone was: what is all this deal with rooting? I read a lot of articles on how to root my phone but I just couldn&amp;#8217;t see what benefits I would get from it. I had had an iPhone and I knew the benefits I could get from jailbreaking, but I just didn&amp;#8217;t know what I could get from rooting.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Well, rooting is in its definition a way to obtain root access to your phone. Does this still not tell you much? Good, then read on.&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This was the geek definition. Now, translating this into English, it means that some applications (some of them widely available in the Android Market), require some deeper privileges to work. Applications like Wireless Tether or Quick Boot are just a few examples of these apps.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  By rooting your phone, it won&amp;#8217;t become faster but it won&amp;#8217;t become slower either. What rooting means is that you&amp;#8217;ll have the &lt;strong&gt;option&lt;/strong&gt; to grant some applications more access than they would normally have.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Now, as to knowing whether your phone is rooted or not, that&amp;#8217;s a quite simple task. A rooted Android phone will have an additional application (installed automatically upon the rooting process), that is called &amp;#8220;Superuser Permissions&amp;#8221;. You don&amp;#8217;t need to use this app but just the fact alone that it sits there, gives you this possibility. If an application ever requires root permissions, you will get a notice saying that the app is requesting super user permissions. Obviously, if you trust the app you will grant these permissions &amp;#8211; if you don&amp;#8217;t trust it, you&amp;#8217;ll deny them.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Angry Birds for Android (Now in the Android Market!)</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/android_bird.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[391]&quot; title=&quot;android_bird&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-393 alignleft&quot; title=&quot;android_bird&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/android_bird.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;163&quot; height=&quot;143&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Anyone who owns an iPhone or who has a friend who owns an iPhone will probably know about Angry Birds. Angry Birds is this awesome game where you hurl all kinds of different birds with different abilities at some nasty pigs. The goal of each level is kill all of the pigs and keep progressing through the different levels, with different obstacles and new birds.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Sounds like a game you&amp;#8217;d like to play on your Android phone? Well read on then!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--more--&gt;The good people at Roxio finally had mercy on us, Android users, and decided to release a version of this game on the Android platform. You can find it in the Android Market as a Lite Beta version. I&amp;#8217;ve had the chance to try it on my Samsung Galaxy S and let me tell you: it&amp;#8217;s 
  
  &lt;strong&gt;orders of magnitude&lt;/strong&gt; faster than the same game on my iPad. Absolutely stunning and fluid. Give it a go!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/angrybirds.png&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[391]&quot; title=&quot;angrybirds&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-392&quot; title=&quot;angrybirds&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/angrybirds.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;175&quot; height=&quot;175&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(Don’t know what this is? Download an app called “Barcode Scanner” and scan this code to download “Angry Birds” right away!)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>iPad gets the iOS 4.2 in November (iPhones get iOS 4.1 now)</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IOS_4.0.2_on_the_iPhone_4.png&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[387]&quot; title=&quot;IOS_4.0.2_on_the_iPhone_4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-388&quot; title=&quot;IOS_4.0.2_on_the_iPhone_4&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IOS_4.0.2_on_the_iPhone_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;136&quot; height=&quot;204&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As per my previous coverage of the Apple event where several new iPods and a new iTunes was announced, I&amp;#8217;m making this post so that iPad owners can sigh with relief regarding the iOS. Yes, we will get an update, yes it will have multi-tasking and make the iPad (even more) awesome.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Read on to get all the juicy details&amp;#8230;&lt;!--more--&gt;We will have to wait until November 2010 unfortunately but I&amp;#8217;d say it&amp;#8217;s a wait well worth. In the meanwhile, the current iPhones (except those for which support has been discontinued) will get the 4.1 update immediately which will, amongst other things, fix the proximity sensor issue in the iPhone 4, introduce a new revision of Safari and finally, users will be able to disable the spell checker. As a Portuguese who owns an iPad without a Portuguese spell checker, this comes as a blessing. No, Apple, I don&amp;#8217;t want you to spell check my Portuguese text with an English spell checker.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Apple&amp;#8217;s new iPod line-up, iOS 4.2 and iTunes 10</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Just a few minutes ago Steve Jobs has finished his keynote speech where he presented us with a few new things. First and foremost we heard about the new version of the iOS! That&amp;#8217;s right, iOS 4.2 is coming out November 2010 and it will come out not only for the iPhone 4 but also for the&amp;#8230;. YES, you guessed right! FOR THE iPAD!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Did I get you curious with the new things announced at this Apple event? Well then, keep on reading to get the rest of the story!&lt;!--more--&gt;The iOS 4.2 will bring your normal improvements that come with every release and it will also include this new feature Apple dubbed as &amp;#8220;AirPlay&amp;#8221;. AirPlay is essentially a way for you to stream any kind of content from your iPhone/iPad into the new Apple TV. So that&amp;#8217;s all for the iOS 4.2 &amp;#8211; AirPlay and finally an iPad version. This means we&amp;#8217;ll finally get multitasking on our iPads. Ace!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Next up were the iPods. Steve claimed Apple had redesigned their whole iPod line-up and so they did! There&amp;#8217;s this new iPod shuffle that is smaller and comes in all these neat colours. This is basically just a reiteration of the shuffle design with no screen and a wheel with a few buttons to play, pause and skip tracks. The cheapest version will sport 2Gb of internal memory and &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_ipod/family/ipod_shuffle?mco=MTM3NDkzMDI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;it will go for $49&lt;/a&gt;. No word if there will be versions with larger memory.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/design_finger20100901.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[379]&quot; title=&quot;design_finger20100901&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-380&quot; title=&quot;design_finger20100901&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/design_finger20100901.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;148&quot; height=&quot;162&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The most amazing revamp they did, however, was with the iPod Nano. They got rid of the wheel below the screen and they&amp;#8217;ve made the screen smaller&amp;#8230;. and touch capable! The new iPod Nano is now a cute little square with a touch screen. Quite cool! There are two versions of this, one at 8Gb and the other at 16Gb, &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_ipod/family/ipod_nano?mco=MTM3NDcwMTA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;which cost $149 and $179&lt;/a&gt; respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Finally on the iPod market, Apple has also made the predicted move. They&amp;#8217;ve released an iPhone-4-esque version of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_ipod/family/ipod_touch?mco=MTM3NDY2Mzg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt;. It now comes with a 5 megapixel camera on the back, a front-facing camera and you guessed it right: Facetime capabilities. The new iPod Touch will also support the AirPlay, as will all devices with the new iOS4.2.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/itunes-10-and-ping-take-on-facebook.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[379]&quot; title=&quot;itunes-10-and-ping-take-on-facebook&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-382&quot; title=&quot;itunes-10-and-ping-take-on-facebook&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/itunes-10-and-ping-take-on-facebook.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;78&quot; height=&quot;78&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Along with the news for today also came the new version of iTunes. The new iTunes 10 will come with a new logo, as according to Steve it wouldn&amp;#8217;t make sense to have the CD on it anymore. Considering that the logo had been designed 10 years ago (according to Mr. Jobs) then I&amp;#8217;m compelled to agree with him; not that I find the new logo much more attractive, but hey, it&amp;#8217;s a matter of taste. The new iTunes also brings a social networking service for music called Ping. Apparently, Ping &amp;#8220;is not Facebook, it is not Twitter, it&amp;#8217;s a social networking service for music&amp;#8221;. I&amp;#8217;m still not entirely sold on the idea but the notion seems to be sharing what you&amp;#8217;re listening to and what you&amp;#8217;ve downloaded. It seems to me this will be Apple&amp;#8217;s own last.fm, with direct integration with iOS.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Finally, Uncle Steve introduced the new Apple TV. Their new TV box is much smaller than their previous iteration and it will integrate with the AirPlay present on the iOS. Apparently they got some feedback from their customers and the new service will be more rental-oriented and the prices will go significantly down to compensate for this. With the new service you&amp;#8217;ll get newly released films for just $4.99 and TV show episodes for $0.99 &amp;#8211; a bargain, I say. Makes me wish I was living in the US&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The new Apple TV service will also support Netflix streaming which means that if you&amp;#8217;re a subscriber, you&amp;#8217;ll be able to stream contents directly into your television. Still on the streaming front, the new iTunes will also allow people to stream stuff directly into the Apple TV, without much fuss. That&amp;#8217;s a neat little feature that&amp;#8217;s been around with the XBOX 360 for a while now and Apple has their own version built right into the Apple TV.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The Apple event had to finish on a high note and as such they invited Chris Martin to put on a small show for the audience. Neat!
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CyanogenMod 6.0 Released (Still No Galaxy S Support)</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Just a couple of days ago, the good folk &amp;#8216;Cyanogen&amp;#8217; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyanogenmod.com/home/cyanogenmod-6-0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;released version 6.0&lt;/a&gt; of their much acclaimed CyanogenMod. To my (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyanogenmod.com/home/cyanogenmod-6-0/comment-page-3#comment-17605&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyanogenmod.com/home/cyanogenmod-6-0/comment-page-2#comment-17465&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyanogenmod.com/home/cyanogenmod-6-0/comment-page-2#comment-17474&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;people&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt;) sadness though, it still does not support the Samsung Galaxy S nor any of its other flavours (Vibrant, Captivate, etc).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  According to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyanogenmod.com/home/cyanogenmod-6-0-status-update&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; by the same gentleman, Vibrant support (and hopefully all the rest, by affinity) might be coming to version 6.1. Until this version is released let&amp;#8217;s just hold onto that thought and pray they are serious about it!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  In the meanwhile, maybe you&amp;#8217;d like to give one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/2010/08/samsung-galaxy-s-gets-android-2-2-froyo-beta/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Froyo builds a spin&lt;/a&gt;?

        <title>Samsung Galaxy S Gets Android 2.2 (Froyo) [Beta]</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/froyogalaxy.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[367]&quot; title=&quot;froyogalaxy&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-370&quot; title=&quot;froyogalaxy&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/froyogalaxy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;216&quot; height=&quot;217&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In case you were not aware yet, there are Froyo builds available out there &lt;strong&gt;RIGHT NOW&lt;/strong&gt; for the Samsung Galaxy S. You just have to be aware that these builds are in fact beta builds released by Samsung and thus might still be a bit buggy and crash-ey. Still, it shouldn&amp;#8217;t break your phone. If anything you&amp;#8217;ll just have to reflash it back with Éclair which is perfectly possible and very safe.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So you want to give these Froyo builds a try? After all there are already &lt;strong&gt;three&lt;/strong&gt; betas out there so it can&amp;#8217;t be that bad, right? Well, just read on for a walk through on how to get these builds and how to get them on your phone!&lt;!--more--&gt;For this walk through I&amp;#8217;m going to assume you&amp;#8217;ve never flashed a firmware &amp;#8220;through the back door&amp;#8221; before. Essentially there are two ways of flashing a firmware onto the Samsung Galaxy S. You can either use Samsung Kies which is an application very much like Nokia&amp;#8217;s PC Suite, or you can use Odin. Odin is a hacker&amp;#8217;s tool. It&amp;#8217;s not an official tool by Samsung but instead it&amp;#8217;s a tool that allows you to flash any firmware you want, as long as you have the files for it. To flash these Froyo betas we are, obviously, using Odin.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  First and foremost you should obtain all the files that you need, so here&amp;#8217;s a list of what you&amp;#8217;re going to need during the process:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Odin &amp;#8211; the flasher tool
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Either the 512 or the 513 PIT file (read after step 4 to know which one you need)
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    You get both the above tools by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wuala.com/Samsung%20Galaxy%20S/Firewares%20,%20Updates%20and%20Odin/Odin%20&amp;amp;%20Bootloader(.PIT)/?key=AfzUZSU4SpKU&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;clicking here&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The firmware that you want to flash.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  You can get the latest Froyo build at the time of writing (i9000XXJP3) by going here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://rapidshare.com/files/415790394/I9000XXJP3.7z&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rapidshare&lt;/a&gt;. Now, as far as the PIT files go, normally you need the 512 file but some firmwares will require the 513. For this XXJP3, you will need the &lt;strong&gt;512 PIT file&lt;/strong&gt; which you can get from the link on step 3.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After you have downloaded all the files, make sure you &lt;strong&gt;UNPLUG YOUR PHONE&lt;/strong&gt; from your computer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, here’s all the steps you need to get to the actual flashing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn off your phone and remove your SIM and SD cards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hold the following buttons at the same time: Volume Down, Home and Power button.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After doing the step above, your screen should say “Download mode”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fire up Odin &lt;strong&gt;BEFORE&lt;/strong&gt; you plug your phone to the USB port.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plug the phone with the USB cord.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After step 5, Odin should detect your Galaxy S and it should acknowledge the connection where it says &amp;#8220;ID:COM&amp;#8221;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  When Odin has recognized your phone, you need to load all the files you&amp;#8217;ve downloaded. Keep in mind that the firmware has to be extracted and in it you will find three files: the CSC, the [Modem/Phone] and the [PDA/Code]. Load all the files in their respective slots on Odin and load the 512 PIT file as well. After you&amp;#8217;ve done this, just press &amp;#8220;Start&amp;#8221; and let it rip 🙂 it will take a while and &lt;strong&gt;DO NOT&lt;/strong&gt; remove the cable before the process is completed. You will know once the process is completed as Odin will tell you it has finished and your phone will boot back up normally. Keep in mind that the phone will reboot at least once and you should still let it do its thing before it&amp;#8217;s come to a full stop.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After this is done, just enjoy your new Froyo phone 😀
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;WORD OF ADVICE:&lt;/strong&gt; After you&amp;#8217;ve switched to Android 2.2 Froyo, the method I described in my other post on how to root and apply the lag fix on the phone &lt;strong&gt;no longer will work&lt;/strong&gt;. To root and apply the lag fix you will need to use a different method so please, don&amp;#8217;t try to use that on a Froyo Galaxy S.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;ALSO&amp;#8230;!:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;m not to be held responsible if you brick your phone in the process of flashing firmwares. I&amp;#8217;m just providing some guidance which if for some reason does not work for you, I am not to be held accountable.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Happy flashing!
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tiago is now officially an ASF committer!</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/derbylogo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[357]&quot; title=&quot;derbylogo&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-358 alignleft&quot; title=&quot;derbylogo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/derbylogo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;206&quot; height=&quot;143&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;True to the proverbial &amp;#8220;feather in the cap&amp;#8221;, I have been promoted to committer with the project I have been participating on during the last few months, &lt;a href=&quot;http://db.apache.org/derby/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apache Derby&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;#8217;s not much to say except that it feels really good to have your hard work recognized 🙂
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Apache Derby is a great project with a really nice community of helpful people and it was through Derby that I have participated and successfully completed the Google Summer of Code challenge for two years in a row! It&amp;#8217;s always a great challenge even to the sharpest mind and most advanced skills because this is an extensive project that has already been around for more than a decade. Over this period different developers have participated on it which adds to the challenge of reengineering and simple engineering of new features when the need arises. I can&amp;#8217;t say this is a disadvantage though as it is an excellent way of being exposed to actual production code from an IT giant (Apache Derby once was IBM Cloudscape). It&amp;#8217;s also exciting because the changes that you make will actually have an impact on the thousands of people that use Apache Derby and for this reason all changes have to be done with most care to keep Derby&amp;#8217;s performance up to the challenge as well as to ensure that all standards are kept.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  With this said, I&amp;#8217;ll just leave here the link to the &amp;#8220;historical&amp;#8221; vote in the ASF list 🙂

        <title>Samsung Galaxy S Lag Issue (And How To Fix It) &amp;#8211; Android 2.1 [Updated]</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;[Updated &amp;#8211; Jump to the end of the post for a detailed walkthrough]&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  As some of my readers may know, I have recently traded in my Maemo-wielding Nokia N900 for a brand new Samsung Galaxy S. This move was led by several reasons that I am not going to go in detail in this post now but I did it and I was very happy with my new phone. In comparison with the Nokia it was super fast and best of all, it runs Android which is, in my opinion, a great mobile operating system.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--more--&gt;Now, all was well until I started hearing about these supposed lag issues of the Galaxy S and I honestly didn&amp;#8217;t know what it was all about. The phone seemed fast enough for me and I was generally very happy with it. Sure, sometimes it would hang for 2 or 3 seconds but nothing to worrying. I genuinely thought it was just normal hiccups like we sometimes get on our computers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Everything changed when I decided to give one of the lag fixes a go. I thought &amp;#8220;hey, why not?&amp;#8221;, I had wanted to root my device for a while now so I could just as well go the extra mile and apply the lag fix as well, and boy, was I missing on speed. After rooting and applying the patch everything is just snappy. There&amp;#8217;s no more hiccups at all and apps just load instantly without any wait at all. For example, when I refresh my inbox using GMail it also takes WAY LESS time than it would before, which really surprised me. Browsing also feels faster and even the benchmarking tool &amp;#8220;Quadrant Standard&amp;#8221; reports the Galaxy S as being twice as fast as the Motorola Droid X! Actually, with this fix, the Galaxy S is at the top of the food chain with the closest phone to provide even similar results being the Nexus One on Froyo.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So my advice is: apply this patch asap. It will eat 1Gb of your internal memory card but trust me: it&amp;#8217;s so very worth it. I&amp;#8217;m including two videos in this post. One of them teaches you how to root the phone while the other guides you through the actual fix. Just apply them both (first root then fix) and off you go.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  If you notice the phone to be faster, please drop me a comment below.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Cheers!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I know I have the videos below and they&amp;#8217;re pretty straight forward, but since this post is getting so much popularity, I thought I&amp;#8217;d make a step by step walkthrough that will guide you through the whole process of rooting AND applying the lag fix. Let&amp;#8217;s start with the rooting, shall we?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The next steps are for &lt;strong&gt;ROOTING&lt;/strong&gt; your Samsung Galaxy S (i9000):
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download this file: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/update.zip&quot;&gt;update&lt;/a&gt;.zip&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plug your phone to your computer and mount the memory cards through the notification bar.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place this update.zip in the root of your INTERNAL SD card. It should be the one with lots of folders. Just place it right in the card, outside any particular folder.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unmount the USB connection through the notification bar.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn off your phone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With your phone turned off, press the following keys at the same time: Volume Up, Home and Power button. Keep holding them until you see the Samsung Galaxy S writings on the screen, then you can let go.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You will be presented with a menu, just choose the option that allows you to flash the update.zip using the volume up and volume down keys. To select the option just push the home key.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wait for the phone to reboot on its own et voilà! It’s done!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next steps are for &lt;strong&gt;APPLYING THE LAG FIX&lt;/strong&gt; onto your Samsung Galaxy S (i9000):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Ok, so I cheated. I&amp;#8217;m not going to give you steps for this because&amp;#8230;. it&amp;#8217;s the same as the steps above! So, &lt;strong&gt;if you have already rooted your phone&lt;/strong&gt;, repeat the steps above &lt;strong&gt;BUT&lt;/strong&gt; with this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/update1.zip&quot;&gt;update&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;WARNING: &lt;/strong&gt; The name of this second file is update1.zip. You &lt;strong&gt;MUST&lt;/strong&gt; take the &amp;#8220;1&amp;#8221; off before you copy it to your phone, otherwise it will NOT work! You also need to know that possibly you won&amp;#8217;t see the &amp;#8220;.zip&amp;#8221; extension. This is fine! If you don&amp;#8217;t see it, DON&amp;#8217;T add it! It just means Windows is hiding it for you and that&amp;#8217;s perfectly fine.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;m still leaving the videos below and in case you have doubts or need more help, drop me a comment below. No registration required! (The comment might take a few minutes to appear as I need to approve them manually)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;

        <title>Samsung Galaxy S and the iPhone 4&amp;#8217;s amazing screen</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I went into an O2 store today. I was merely looking to handle the new iPhone 4, to see how it looked like in person, to see how it felt in my hand and&amp;#8230; obviously, to test the death grip, or, more correctly, the death touch. Yes, you don&amp;#8217;t really have to grip it like Steve J. suggests, you really just have to touch it on that joint point on the bottom left corner of the phone and the signal goes all the way down to just two, and then one bar. You can clearly see the effects of the new firmware though, it no longer goes into no signal, it will still tell you that there&amp;#8217;s some signal, while in fact it&amp;#8217;s probably impossible to make any calls at that point. But anyway, I was there, I tested it. I didn&amp;#8217;t grip the iPhone, I merely pressed my index finger against that tiny little spot and the signal instantly started dropping from the full five bars to two bars and ultimately to just one bar. Similarly, as soon as I raised my finger from that spot, it gained back the signal to full strength. This is why I&amp;#8217;m dubbing this issue not &amp;#8220;death grip&amp;#8221; but &amp;#8220;death touch&amp;#8221;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--more--&gt;Not all is bad about the iPhone 4 though. The screen is amazing, tantalizing, fabulous, ridiculously fantastic and I might just have ran out of adjectives to describe how &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; it feels to look at such a screen. It&amp;#8217;s like there&amp;#8217;s no screen at all and you&amp;#8217;re just looking at something &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221;. If you&amp;#8217;ve read my blog, you&amp;#8217;ll know that by now I loathe Steve Jobs. He&amp;#8217;s an arrogant prick who bullies his employees and he might as well have been the one who gave the order to go ahead with this design, despite having been warned about the issues it could have. Still, the screen of the iPhone 4 is just&amp;#8230; fantastic. It&amp;#8217;s something that has to be seen in person to be wooed by it and trust me, you will be.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Anyway, enough beating the dead horse with a stick and moving on to more serious matters. I&amp;#8217;ve had my eye on the Samsung Galaxy S for a while now and based on the reviews and videos I saw of it, I was pretty much convinced on getting one. I had a few deals on eBay that I was keeping track of  and I was just waiting for my own phone to sell to then buy the Galaxy. However, what was not my surprise when on the O2 store, I saw the Samsung Galaxy S for sale and it had actually been one of the motives for me to go up to the store: I wanted to try the phone in person just to get the feel of it. I asked the lady if she had one other than that one on display as it had no battery and she went to get one, a BNIB handset, just for me to try. I was impressed with her amiability with this and I had the chance to take a glance at the price tag &amp;#8211; £319 it read. I thought to myself that it was a really nice price but it was probably locked to O2, which isn&amp;#8217;t desirable at all for me. I&amp;#8217;m at a point in my life that I might have to move to God knows where and having a phone that&amp;#8217;s locked to a British network is anything but ideal for me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The lady came back with the handset and she let me mess around with it a bit. I tried (and failed) to enable Swype, and on a casual chit chat with the O2 lady, I asked her whether the phone was locked and she told me she didn&amp;#8217;t actually know. Those phones were supposed to be sold on contracts and those are usually unlocked, but she didn&amp;#8217;t know. She also told me that she was fairly sure they were unlocked, as the box had no O2 branding whatsoever, but she didn&amp;#8217;t know for sure. After asking a few of her colleagues, none of them seemed to be sure either but at some point, one of them assured me it was unlocked to all networks, and I just knew it: I have to buy this phone. And I did. I made an excellent deal, better than any of the deals on eBay because I get 1 year warranty and in the end it&amp;#8217;s actually cheaper than anything on eBay.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So, to everyone who&amp;#8217;s wanting to buy a Samsung Galaxy S, I say try your local O2 shop. Maybe they have a few units like this!
&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Alright so I know everyone has been talking about this and it has been debated and criticized ad nauseum but this latest press conference was nothing short of a joke. For those of you who are unaware of what happened, let me start from the beginning.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Apple released the iPhone 4 and dubbed it as the best smartphone ever. It was the best smartphone Apple had ever built, it was the best smartphone on Earth and&amp;#8230; &amp;#8220;there&amp;#8217;s one more thing&amp;#8230; look at the rim. This is also the antenna and is part of some brilliant engineering.&amp;#8221; (this is more or less what Steve Jobs preached at the iPhone launch). When making this presentation, little did Jobs know (or didn&amp;#8217;t he?) that this antenna design was going to backfire so gracefully, like a Russian Roulette player who&amp;#8217;s about to fire the gun against his head for the sixth time in a row. And it did fire.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--more--&gt;Jobs can bullshit us all he likes, with statistics and with supposed facts that the iPhone 4 only drops 1/100th more calls than the 3GS but fact remains: the iPhone 4 has a massive flaw that was overlooked by Apple&amp;#8217;s engineers. This flaw hit all sorts of media. It was on 
  
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/5573504/unofficial-finger-test-reveals-iphone-antenna-issue-impacts-reception-and-transmission&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;technology websites&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jul/14/apple-shares-dive-iphone4-criticism?intcmp=240&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mainstream newspapers&lt;/a&gt; and it even hit some TV channels like &lt;a href=&quot;http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/07/13/iphone.4.duct.tape/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.consumerreports.org/electronics/2010/07/apple-iphone-4-antenna-issue-iphone4-problems-dropped-calls-lab-test-confirmed-problem-issues-signal-strength-att-network-gsm.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/a&gt; in the US went from recommending the iPhone 4 to NOT recommending it at all when they found out (and tested for themselves) about this issue with the reception. After all this bad publicity, after &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.co.uk/finance?q=NASDAQ:AAPL&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AAPL&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; shares dropping roughly $30 per share, Jobs knew something had to be done. And so he did, he called for a press conference and they approached the issue of the antenna&amp;#8230; in one of the worst ways possible.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  At the conference, Jobs&amp;#8217; claim was that all smartphones have this issue. Conveniently, they played videos of other phones being grasped firmly in a hand and of how the bars would go all the way down. Conveniently, they were videos. They weren&amp;#8217;t showing it live, the tests weren&amp;#8217;t even being done in one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/5589054/apples-100-million-iphone-test-chamber&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;anechoic chambers&lt;/a&gt; that Jobs&amp;#8217; claimed to have spent $100 million on to test their phones; it was just someone, holding a series of phones, connected to God knows what operator, and showing how the bars go down. What Apple failed to address however, was the fact that you don&amp;#8217;t need the so-called &amp;#8216;death grip&amp;#8217; to get the bars to drop. All you need to do is bridge the two antennas on the bottom-left corner of the phone. Place your finger on top of it and your call quality will drop dramatically, to a point where the call might disconnect and to a point where you&amp;#8217;ll have no reception at all. Apple&amp;#8217;s response, in sum, was: all phones have this problem, the iPhone is not perfect, but here&amp;#8217;s a bumper anyway to keep you quiet.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Jobs. If you are so confident that the iPhone 4 has no problem at all, why are you giving your customers bumpers that fix the problem? What, wait. But there is no problem, is there? Is there a problem that affects all phones and thus you are appeasing the customers with a solution or is there no problem at all. I&amp;#8217;m confused now.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  In any case Jobs, I understand you. After the shit&amp;#8217;s been done you really can&amp;#8217;t admit to it anymore. You&amp;#8217;d take another massive hit to the shares of AAPL and that&amp;#8217;s bad for business. You also can&amp;#8217;t do a global recall because that would mean replacing every single iPhone 4 by new models without the issue and that would mean catastrophic losses plus a massive stain on Apple&amp;#8217;s history. So all in all Jobs, well done. You took the sensible way out. Not the way out that truly has your customers at heart but the way out that is best for everybody.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pie Chart Yourself Into a Diet?</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Pretty much everyone who could actually use with a diet has problems with it. They either don&amp;#8217;t know how much they should be eating of each of the different types of food, or they simply shun the idea out of their minds when push comes to shove. With this in mind, a very clever Portuguese guy and some other people (nationality bias much? 🙂 ) came up with this plate that has a wheel of nutrition drawn on it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This way, you will not only know exactly how much you should be eating of each of the wheel&amp;#8217;s categories, but you will also feel guilt ridden if your t-bone steak occupies the whole vegetable and cereal sections. These plates are apparently still just a proof of concept, but I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure you can even photoshop the wheels yourself and have them transferred into normal white plates.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lufthansa offers Gray Powell flight to Germany</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Everyone who follows the technology world would know the name Gray Powell. This is the name of the lad who &lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/5520438/how-apple-lost-the-next-iphone?skyline=true&amp;amp;s=i&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lost his prototype iPhone 4G&lt;/a&gt; at a German beer bar. Well, guess what? Lufthansa is offering him a business class flight to Munich for him to &amp;#8220;pick up where he last left off&amp;#8221;.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Imagine Cup and volcano ash</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So! It&amp;#8217;s been a while and I come back with nothing but sad and unhappy stories.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  As perhaps some of you knew, my team was one of the UK finalists in the Microsoft Imagine Cup competition. As fate wanted, we did not win. We came home, not empty-handed but in a way, empty-hearted. Maybe it is for the best; my team is composed of Master&amp;#8217;s students and the workload isn&amp;#8217;t comparable. I did not expect to have enough time to make it through to the finals, so maybe it is indeed for the best that someone else won.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Still, we got some loot from this competition! We won a magnificent Microsoft LifeCam HD and a superb Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 6000, with the new BlueTrack technology! Last but not least, we also got a diploma signed by Bill Gates himself! Quite good huh?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Unfortunately I cannot post many details from this visit to Microsoft&amp;#8217;s campus in Reading as we were all forced to sign an NDA to prevent us from leaking the latest details. All that I can say is that I&amp;#8217;ve tried a Windows Phone 7 and it&amp;#8217;s amazing. It&amp;#8217;s a complete break with Windows Mobile and it is definitely a great break. From my experience I can say that the OS still feels a bit unpolished on certain aspects like image handling, but that&amp;#8217;s to be expected as it hasn&amp;#8217;t even been released yet. I also got to try a Microsoft Surface in person and whoa&amp;#8230;. it&amp;#8217;s quite an amazing experience and I quite like the applications they have to showcase it. Perhaps the only disappointing factor is that it doesn&amp;#8217;t use either resistive or capacitive technologies, but instead it resorts to a projection and five cameras to detect touches. That is why it is such a tall device.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  We also got a nice presentation by a gentleman from Lionhead Studios but unfortunately they had really strong feelings about the NDA and I am really not supposed to say anything about that!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Moving on to the next topic there&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8230; volcano ash! Namely Eyjafjallajökull&amp;#8217;s ash. This is the name of the very nasty Icelandic volcano that has stopped me from going back to Portugal for my well deserved holidays. I had a flight booked for the 16th which got cancelled, then I rebooked it for today (the 19th) and again it got cancelled, and right now I have it booked for this Friday, hoping that things will look better in a few days.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The latest news on this is that the volcano comes from the UK Met Office (check image) and they tell us that it has actually stopped erupting and that maybe now the skies will start clearing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/VAG_1271676889.png&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[314]&quot; title=&quot;VAG_1271676889&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-317&quot; title=&quot;VAG_1271676889&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/VAG_1271676889.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;453&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

        <title>Apple Tablet &amp;#8211; the iPad is&amp;#8230; meh</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The so much awaited Apple Tablet has finally been announced by good ole Steve Jobs. My first impression? Meh. Put it this way, I was very very excited about the Apple Tablet, I was amused that the name could have gone the iSlate way (is late, get it?), but even the name is a total and uttermost failure. iPad&amp;#8230; what&amp;#8217;s with the easy iPod pun?!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Those of us who read Gizmodo and other technology-oriented websites have been showering in mockups of how the iPad would look like and truth to be told, most of them look better than this chunky piece of an eBook reader. What&amp;#8217;s this supposed to be anyway? A phone? But it has no 3G&amp;#8230; An eBook reader? But it costs $1000&amp;#8230; An MP3/video player? BUT IT COSTS $1000!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Come on guys, who does not sincerely believe that Apple has just shot themselves in the foot please raise your hands and drop me a comment with sound reasoning. As for me, if I had Apple stock I&amp;#8217;d be hitting the sell button as hard as I could right now&amp;#8230; poor move Jobs, poor move&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Photos after the break (courtesy of Gizmodo).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: Alright, alright, it only costs $500 after all. My point still remains: it is ugly and it only allows one app running at a time&amp;#8230; $500 for a giant iPhone? Meh.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>iMacs and the yellow tinted screen</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Oh oh! No, not Santa, this is actually a juicy story. Mark Wilson at &lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/5436442/apple-has-thwarted-my-efforts-so-i-need-your-help?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+gizmodo/full+(Gizmodo)&amp;amp;utm_content=Google+Reader&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/a&gt; brings us an issue with the latest Apple&amp;#8217;s iMacs. According to said person, some of the latest iMacs randomly display a yellow tinted screen, turning the whites into&amp;#8230; well&amp;#8230; yellow. Manufacturing issues like this happen you say, and I would agree; that&amp;#8217;s not really the issue in this case.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The issue is the fact that Mark&amp;#8217;s iMac was exchanged but the replacement computer is also icteric. So what&amp;#8217;s the deal? Well, I&amp;#8217;m not a fan boy for either side, I&amp;#8217;m not fanatic so this brings me no special joy; despite that, I share Mark&amp;#8217;s opinion on the issue: multi-thousand dollar computers, computers that are known for being overpriced for their specifications, shouldn&amp;#8217;t have issues like this. Moreso, the issue should never happen again on a replacement computer. This can only mean one of two things &amp;#8211; either the issue is happening on a large percentage of iMacs or Mark has just been extremely unlucky. Considering Apple&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2235367&amp;amp;start=0&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=824940&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rapport&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2212682&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2238709&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; and faulty parts, I would go with the former.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Right now Apple has been creepy and resorted to shady backstage data mining to flag Mark&amp;#8217;s Apple account to disallow any other exchanges; apparently his computer will now be repaired instead. Mark isn&amp;#8217;t happy and he&amp;#8217;s trying to spread the word; this is my attempt to help him and to get Apple to change this behavior. This would be acceptable from a cheap computer brand but not from Apple, THE most expensive computer brand, whose flagship is to produce computers with above-par quality. This sure as hell isn&amp;#8217;t above-par.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Adobe and the slap on Apple</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Well, for some weird reason, Apple refuses to give in and have Adobe port Flash over to the iPhone. It would be a massive advantage if we could see an iPhone with a full blown version of Flash, as opposed to Flash Lite. But&amp;#8230; Apple won&amp;#8217;t bend. So what does Apple do? The best it can do right now: get people angry at Apple.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Below is the image that people will see when they try to download Flash on their iPhones (courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2009/11/02/adobe-engages-apple-in-passive-aggressive-warfare-with-iphones/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt;):
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sidekick data recovered (most of it, maybe all)</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Batman-Robin-Photograph-C12150175.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[278]&quot; title=&quot;BatmanRobinSidekick&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-279&quot; style=&quot;border: 0pt none; float:left; padding-right:10px; padding-bottom:10px&quot; title=&quot;BatmanRobinSidekick&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Batman-Robin-Photograph-C12150175.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;BatmanRobinSidekick&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;192&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;You just have to take the fun of being a critical blogger, don&amp;#8217;t you T-Mobile? It seems that T-Mobile has actually managed to recover most of the data that was deemed &amp;#8216;probably lost&amp;#8217; as the result of the massive server crash. According to the magenta folks, they will be able to recover most, if not all, of their customers&amp;#8217; data. Good news for the Sidekick owners, but if I was you I&amp;#8217;d just go with Robin anyway&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Official Microsoft statement after the break.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[via &lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/5382208/most-if-not-all-sidekick-data-recovered&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dear T-Mobile Sidekick customers,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On behalf of Microsoft, I want to apologize for the recent problems with the Sidekick service and give you an update on the steps we have taken to resolve these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We are pleased to report that we have recovered most, if not all, customer data for those Sidekick customers whose data was affected by the recent outage. We plan to begin restoring users’ personal data as soon as possible, starting with personal contacts, after we have validated the data and our restoration plan. We will then continue to work around the clock to restore data to all affected users, including calendar, notes, tasks, photographs and high scores, as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We now believe that data loss affected a minority of Sidekick users. If your Sidekick account was among those affected, please continue to log into these forums for the latest updates about when data restoration will begin, and any steps you may need to take. We will work with T-Mobile to post the next update on data restoration timing no later than Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We have determined that the outage was caused by a system failure that created data loss in the core database and the back-up. We rebuilt the system component by component, recovering data along the way. This careful process has taken a significant amount of time, but was necessary to preserve the integrity of the data.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We will continue working closely with T-Mobile to restore user data as quickly as possible. We are eager to deliver the level of reliable service that our incredibly loyal customers have become accustomed to, and we are taking immediate steps to help ensure this does not happen again. Specifically, we have made changes to improve the overall stability of the Sidekick Service and initiated a more resilient backup process to ensure that the integrity of our database backups is maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Once again, we apologize for this situation and the inconvenience that it has created. Please know that we are working all-out to resolve this situation and restore the reliability of the service.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Roz Ho&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Corporate Vice President&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Premium Mobile Experiences, Microsoft Corporation&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>T-Mobile Sidekick in Danger</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Well, truth to be told this had to happen at some point. According to the good folks at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/10/t-mobile-we-probably-lost-all-your-sidekick-data/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile has most probably lost the data of their customers&amp;#8217; Sidekick phones. The T-Mobile Sidekick is a device that relies heavily on cloud-computing and simple things such as looking up contacts or reading old text messages are done through servers in the cloud (that is to say, in the Internet). So if these servers fail for some reason, or more extremely (like it happened) lose all the data they contain, then the end user is pretty much screwed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I hope for the sake of the costumers that the data isn&amp;#8217;t just lost; I would have also hoped that T-Mobile had off-site, offline backups of all this stuff but that clearly does not seem to be the case. It is also up to our imagination whom to blame for this. Of course that for all the people affected by this problem, T-Mobile will be the one to blame, but whose fault was it in the end? Is it a bug in the servers? Will it happen again? Has it been patched?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Doesn&amp;#8217;t really matter now but here&amp;#8217;s the morale of the story: &lt;strong&gt;ALWAYS &lt;/strong&gt;keep backups of your data.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>&amp;#8216;Ay up me duck!</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  That&amp;#8217;s right folks, despite not having given hourly updates on my trip to England, I am finally here; safe and sound. The trip was quite on the wire but everything just fit perfectly. The flight arrived a little bit late which meant we had to rush over to the correct bus stop within Heathrow but luckily this Taxi Assistant guy pointed us (me and my parents) in the right direction and off we went. With sandwiches bought in-between and eaten right at the bus stop, also with the anxiety feeling peaking a little over what&amp;#8217;s normal. Still, there really was nothing to be anxious about. The bus came, we put our luggage in the trunk and off we were. It was quite tiring to take a 2.30h flight but ahead of that we still had a 2 hour bus trip to Leicester. (Buses are better in Portugal by the way!)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Then once we arrived in Leicester we had the taxi dance; pretty much hopping from taxi to taxi so that we could get to where we wanted. Leicester is quite huge so going from the city center to, say, my accommodation at Mary Gee houses &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; is madness; it&amp;#8217;s about an 1 hour walk. Add the fact that we didn&amp;#8217;t know the city and that the GPS in the iPhone simply &lt;strong&gt;sucks balls&lt;/strong&gt; when you are on foot, and we had but no other choice than to be driven around by some funny Indian men (one of which didn&amp;#8217;t even know where Ratcliffe Road was!).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  By the end of the day I had one burst blister on my heel and we were all pretty tired. The hotel also felt kinda sleazy but the receptionists were all very friendly and we also got free breakfast which was pretty good.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  On the next day, my parents had to leave, which translates as: &amp;#8220;on the next day, it was weeping day&amp;#8221;. We were at Morrison&amp;#8217;s and they had to go to the city center, so that meant it was time to split. They were going to take a taxi and I was going to go back to my accommodation by foot. It was kinda sad but we all knew that this is for the best and that this will actually be great for me! I&amp;#8217;ll be Tiago Espinha, MSc in one year from now which is really exciting! Master Tiago&amp;#8230; yeah, I like the sound of that 😀
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After that I&amp;#8217;ve been having a blast. Hopping from event to event, meeting new people, English, French, Bulgarians, Swiss, etc and it&amp;#8217;s been quite great. The fun&amp;#8217;s about to end though (or to start, depending on your point of view) and my induction week starts on Monday, with departmental registration.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  All in all I&amp;#8217;m really looking forward for this experience and sometimes I come to myself and I can&amp;#8217;t still believe I&amp;#8217;m in the U-friggin-K! But it is true, I&amp;#8217;m here, with the cloudy and freezing weather included.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  That&amp;#8217;s all for today, so cheers!
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A day in the life of a Presario CQ60</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://socialspark.com/metrics/click/profile?opportunity_id=3751&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-2225504-10685232&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-263&quot; style=&quot;float:left; margin:0 1em 1em 0&quot; title=&quot;CQ60&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/t.png&quot; alt=&quot;CQ60&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;117&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So here I am now, finally alone. My owner won&amp;#8217;t leave me alone for a second during the day! I&amp;#8217;m surprised he gave me some rest now, I guess I should enjoy it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Well, first things first so I should introduce myself. I&amp;#8217;m an HP Compaq Presario CQ60-200EP and by the looks of it, I must be pretty darn good as my owner uses me every single day! It can be maddening at times&amp;#8230; having him (literally) push my buttons all the time&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Lately he&amp;#8217;s done a smart move though and installed Windows 7 on me. I feel so much lighter now. It&amp;#8217;s as if I went to the gym regularly for a year&amp;#8230; except I didn&amp;#8217;t!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I don&amp;#8217;t get to do much fun stuff very often but he does a lot of work with me and in a way I&amp;#8217;m happy with that. I like feeling useful and handy and I know my owner trusts me with some pretty serious stuff&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I pack a generous 15.6 inch screen which is pretty wide and still portable (in your face, you 17 inch monsters!). All in all I was very affordable and I&amp;#8217;m a dual core, from Intel &amp;#8211; by far the best CPU maker out there right now. My graphics are also by Nvidia which is pretty darn good, I say. You know, I also have a DVD burner with lightscribe which is the next best thing these days and did I mention that I have an integrated card-reader, a webcam and an HDMI output?! I love it when he plugs me in to his 52 inch flat screen. I feel like a whole different computer when he watches 1080p movies with me!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Do you need a laptop? If you do, I have a few brothers that would gladly live with you and accompany you everywhere! I&amp;#8217;m a sexy piano-black and have a cute aluminum &amp;#8220;Q&amp;#8221; on my lid. Interested? Well, for a limited period I can get you $30 off in orders over $150 on the HP Home Store. Sounds good?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Just go over to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://socialspark.com/metrics/click/profile?opportunity_id=3751&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-2225504-10685232&quot;&gt;HP Home Store&lt;/a&gt; and use the following coupon code: &lt;strong&gt;SV2132&lt;/strong&gt;.

        <title>Windows 7 &amp;#8211; Adjust Aero Peek Delay</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Having recently tried Mac OS X and all of it Exposé and Spaces goodness, I couldn&amp;#8217;t help but to notice that Aero Peek feels like a complete rip off of the Exposé feature. Don&amp;#8217;t take me wrong though, it is not a critic. I am of the opinion that progress can only be made if we pick the best bits and pieces out of everything that is out there and put it all into one package. So while Windows still has a long way to go on user experience matters, I see this as a move forward.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Still, Aero Peek came with an annoyance for me: it takes too damn long! Basically, when you activate Exposé on a Mac (either by having a shortcut or by hovering over a hot corner) you instantly get to your desktop and can see what&amp;#8217;s underneath &amp;#8211; with Aero Peek this takes at least one or two seconds which isn&amp;#8217;t ideal for me by any stretch.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  With that in mind, and since there does not seem to be that much documentation about this yet, Microsoft allows you to adjust that delay time with some registry hacking. To adjust the delay, do the following:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Open regedit (Start -&amp;gt; regedit -&amp;gt; press enter)
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Go to the key &lt;strong&gt;HKEY_CURRENT_USER \ Software \ Microsoft \ Windows \ CurrentVersion \ Explorer \ Advanced&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Once here, create a new DWORD (32 bit) entry with the name &lt;strong&gt;DesktopLivePreviewHoverTime&lt;/strong&gt; and set it to whatever time you&amp;#8217;d like in milliseconds. I found that 100 works best for me but I will leave that at your own discretion.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Now I&amp;#8217;m back to testing Windows 7 RTM &amp;#8211; have a good one!
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>iPhone virus &amp;#8211; avast!</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Soooo&amp;#8230; apparently Mac&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3Z386vXrt4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;can&amp;#8217;t catch viruses&lt;/a&gt; but the iPhone certainly can. There is a flaw in the iPhone&amp;#8217;s software that allows any attacker to gain complete control over your phone. Flaw which Apple is aware of but still hasn&amp;#8217;t patched. The details are simple and as such I will cut to the chase: if you receive an SMS with a single square in it, by the love of God &amp;#8211; &lt;strong&gt;TURN OFF YOUR PHONE&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  You have been warned, be safe, buy a Palm Pré.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>iPhone OS 3.0 Spam Exploit</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; silly folks over at AppleInsider are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/07/22/hackers_break_iphone_push_messaging_blame_apple.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; on a flaw that might open the iPhone OS 3.0 to mass spam. While there is some truth to their claims, they are also being unnecessarily alarmist and making false claims.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The specifics of this exploit is that when you hacktivate an iPhone (i.e. activate it using Jailbreak), your iPhone will be using a private/public key pair to register with Apple&amp;#8217;s PNS (Push Notification Service) that already exists, in other words, it will be using a key that was not generated to your iPhone but that will be common to everyone who hacktivates their iPhone.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  As a result, when a notification comes addressed to that key, all of the iPhones in the world that have been hacktivated would in theory receive that message.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Still, at AppleInsider they claim:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Destroying the application security layer of the iPhone does not itself automatically break PNS, but (&lt;strong&gt;when combined with an &amp;#8220;unofficial activation&amp;#8221; required to use it with unofficial service providers&lt;/strong&gt;) results in the system having no legitimate certificates to use in performing push notifications. Essentially, if the phone is not properly activated as intended through iTunes, the user&amp;#8217;s credentials for signing into Apple&amp;#8217;s PNS messaging servers (which are generated by the device itself in normal conditions) are broken along with the application security layer.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Whoa, whoa, whoa, little Timmy! Let&amp;#8217;s debunk this, shall we?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An unofficial activation (read, hacktivation) is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; required to use it with unofficial service providers. If an iPhone is already officially activated, the jailbreak will not reactivate it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jailbreaking does &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; necessarily mean that you want to use your iPhone with unofficial service providers. Jailbreaking simply allows you to install third-party applications, such that aren’t installed through the regular AppStore.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You need to jailbreak to use the iPhone with an unofficial service provider, but jailbreaking does not have only that purpose. You can for instance jailbreak to run cracked games. Sure, it doesn’t make it any more legitimate or legal, but it is not the same thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Finally, I must stress the notion: if you have an officially activated iPhone and if you jailbroke it afterwards, YOU ARE SAFE. Actually, I am not sure about the status of redsn0w right now, but when it was first released the push notifications would not even work for hacktivated iPhones! Still, if you would activate your iPhone normally and then jailbreak it, you would get your push notifications working. In a nutshell, if you have it officially activated, jailbreak will not put you at risk of being spammed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  As for hacktivated iPhones&amp;#8230; well, tough luck guys. It seems like you are better off turning of the push notifications if you don&amp;#8217;t want to be spammed in a near future.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s correct. Windows 7 was officially released to manufacturing and this version should be available over the course of the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the comemoration video the guy at Microsoft made to celebrate the launch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the whole release schedule, hit up the &lt;a href=&quot;http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windows7/archive/2009/07/21/when-will-you-get-windows-7-rtm.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Windows Team Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Imageshack Hacked? &amp;#8211; Yes!</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The famous website for hosting images, imageshack.us, has just recently been hacked with the manifesto below. Our &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2009/07/10/imageshack-hacked/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; say all images were replaced with this manifesto, but according to the manifesto itself «no images were harmed in the making of this&amp;#8230; image». Let&amp;#8217;s hope for the users&amp;#8217; sake that this is indeed true.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  It remains to be seen what does Imageshack actually have to do with the topic of this manifesto&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Google Chrome OS &amp;#8211; First Screenshots! [UPDATE]</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Here they are! The (supposed) first screenshots of what is to become Google&amp;#8217;s Operating System. The credibility and plausibility of those screenshots is actually flaky, but it&amp;#8217;s the best we have at the moment. Whether they are photoshopped or the real thing, time will tell.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The blog the images were taken from: &lt;a href=&quot;http://chromeosleak.wordpress.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: The blog is a lie! Like I suspected, the leaked screenshots are actually fake. It didn&amp;#8217;t look so bad though!

        <title>Google Chrome OS &amp;#8211; Google&amp;#8217;s Bing Retaliation</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Just a few hours ago Google has announced it will be entering the operating system market. The contestant? Google Chrome OS.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Google&amp;#8217;s goals seem to be speed and simplicity, although it remains unclear where they want to go with this. They go as far as stating that if you spend most of your time on the web, then Chrome OS is for you but this is all still too blurry. Will this be an actual operating system that lives outside the browser? Or is this some sort of mock-up of an operating system that you get in your browser? If it is the first, then I have a hard time finding true utility for it &amp;#8211; a computer that can only browse the net? *Skepticism alert*
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The time frame? Second half of 2010. Hit up the links below for more info:

        <title>Musical Tesla Coil Plans [Updated&amp;#8230;]</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A great deal of people seem to land in my blog searching for the plans for building a Musical Tesla Coil. Therefore, I decided to do some researching myself and I am posting here my findings. I hope you find them useful 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/259168-Tesla-Coil-Construction-Plans.pdf&quot;&gt;Tesla Construction Plans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uoguelph.ca/~antoon/circ/hv/ss-tesla/ss-tesla.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Very Detailed Technical Plans&lt;/a&gt; [Broken]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till the next time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Update: So apparently I still get loads of hits from people trying to get their hands on the schematics for Tesla Coils. I&amp;#8217;m afraid I can&amp;#8217;t help you much on &lt;strong&gt;musical&lt;/strong&gt; Tesla coils, but here&amp;#8217;s a great website that describes all that you need to know to build just a funky Tesla coil: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alansharp.co.uk/homepage.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.alansharp.co.uk/homepage.htm&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; now, go crazy! If you manage to build one, be sure to come back here and post an image. If you post one on the comments zone, I&amp;#8217;ll incorporate it into the post 🙂
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Staples Leiria &amp;#8211; July 6th 2009</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Below is a shot taken in Leiria, Portugal at the doors of the chain retailer Staples. The crowd patiently awaits for the doors to open for a stock-off sale. Later on people ended up losing their patience and forced the entry; the police was called to the spot to help with the crowd control.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  There are reports of people literally camping the store, having parked there at 22h of the previous day and slept there during the night. Amazing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;

        <title>The end of the Ubuntu vs. Windows war!</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  YAY!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Christopher Dawnson over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://education.zdnet.com/?p=2770&amp;amp;tag=nl.e550&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ZDNet&lt;/a&gt; has announced the end of the Ubuntu vs. Windows war, the world is safe again!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Till the next time!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  WAIT! Hold it!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  What the heck?! Wasn&amp;#8217;t ZDNet supposed to be a reliable source of information regarding technology? So what are these shenanigans about his 17 year old saying that they&amp;#8217;re the same? I&amp;#8217;ll tell you what it is: it is the most bold statement I&amp;#8217;ve heard all year, and also the most idiotic one. So just because a 17 year old says that they&amp;#8217;re the same, 6 billion people will just agree and this fact will just be set in stone? Bullshit.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Windows and Linux are different; it&amp;#8217;s about time people realize that. I absolutely need both so is this proof enough that they are ultimately different?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Christopher says: &amp;#8220;Their underlying architectures are quite a bit different, Gnome looks different than the 7 UI, etc.&amp;#8221;. The underlying architectures are quite a bit different, Gnome looks different than 7 does, but apart from that, which by the way is everything that effing matters in an Operating System, they&amp;#8217;re pretty much the same.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I have a Hyundai Getz, my neighbour has a Ferrari, but apart from the engine and the chassis they&amp;#8217;re pretty much the same. They both have wheels! A whole set of four! So they must be the same&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Come on guys&amp;#8230; get serious.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Story of my Life</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Today, I bring you something that happened with me recently and that I think it is worth sharing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  As some of my readers may know, I applied for a Master&amp;#8217;s degree in Advanced Software Engineering at the University of Leicester. As of a couple of months ago, I received a letter saying I had been accepted. The said letter was a conditional offer from the University, where the condition was obtaining my current degree (BSc in Computer Science) with an average grade no lower than 65%.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &amp;#8220;Perfect.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; I thought. 65% in a 20 point scale represents 13 points, which would be totally doable with my 14.2 points average.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Still, just to be sure, I decided to e-mail the Post-Graduate Admissions Office to assert how much would 65% be in my scale. For much of my surprise, I am told that 65% actually corresponds to 16 marks in my grading system. I was shocked. This meant that my goal simply could not be done&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I e-mailed the PGA office back, asking whether that hadn&amp;#8217;t in fact been a mistake. Some days passed. Since the last time I e-mailed the PGA office it took them some two weeks to come back at me, I thought I&amp;#8217;d send in the artillery and decided to call them. The lady who picked up my call didn&amp;#8217;t know how to help me but checked with a colleague who told her that I would have to contact the UK NARIC if I wasn&amp;#8217;t happy with that grade comparison.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So I did. I e-mailed UK NARIC, only to realize that this is actually a paid service in the UK that provides people with comparison statements between systems in foreign countries and the UK system. Without being very helpful, their reply mentioned a £40 fee for requesting such a statement, without a warranty at all that I would get in at Leicester in the end.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  In the same day (yesterday), I also decided to e-mail my course coordinator (Prof. Patrício Domingues) at ESTG; I thought that perhaps he could help me and he did in fact help me. He provided me with a link to the Portuguese Republic Diary (Diário da República) where it clearly states that the grade range of 60% through 69% in the UK corresponds to 16 marks in Portugal. Bummer. It was all going down the drain&amp;#8230; but I wasn&amp;#8217;t just about to give up. There was one last option: having my entrance requirement lowered.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The last thing I did yesterday was e-mailing Ms. Stacey March, from the Department of Computer Science at Leicester. She&amp;#8217;d been the one to announce that I had been accepted so I thought that she could help me in this situation. In my second e-mail, since the artillery had failed before &amp;#8211; I had to send a nuke. And so I did. I factored it all in. I mentioned the fact that on the entry requirements it says that the applicant should have a good Second Class degree, and that Second Class is actually divided in the First and Second division (60 to 69% and 50 to 59% respectively). So technically I do have a Second Class degree with my 14 marks. Plus, I threw all that I have left at them: my work experience at Omerta, the one-month job I got in Leiria, the fact that I am currently engaged in the Google Summer of Code program, and that I still am a Microsoft Student Partner. That, on top of the fact of having scored much higher than what&amp;#8217;s required in the TOEFL exam.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  An hour ago, I had a surprise. The PGA office was e-mailing me, notifying that they reviewed my transcripts and together with UK NARIC they agreed that I would be accepted with a minimum of 13 points in a 20-point based scale.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  YAHOO! 😀
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Essentially I feel like I was accepted twice&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Till the next time 😉
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>iPhone 3.0 Jailbreak and ultrasn0w? It is out!</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  It might be old news for some, but I am sure that not everyone is aware of this yet.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The good folks at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.iphone-dev.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iPhone Dev Team&lt;/a&gt; did it again and after some days that just seemed too long, they released the new tool called redsn0w. This tool is meant to jailbreak the iPhone 3G &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt;, and only with the firmware 3.0 &amp;#8211; jailbreak for the 3GS still hasn&amp;#8217;t been released but since the flaw seems to exist in the 3G, it should only be a matter of days (and of the Dev Team getting their hands on a 3GS &amp;#8211; feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;http://widget.chipin.com/widget/id/0c9fb4b8bbe38374&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;chip in&lt;/a&gt;) until the jailbreak is released.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The process is pretty simple, just update to 3.0 normally through iTunes and when that&amp;#8217;s done, search for the correct IPSW in the following folder (if you&amp;#8217;re using Vista or 7):&lt;br /&gt; C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\iTunes\iPhone Software Updates&lt;br /&gt; (For XP, search around the Application Data folders under Documents and Settings)
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  When you have this file, just feed it to redsn0w and follow the steps. In under 5 minutes you should be running a jailbroken 3.0.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After this is done, if you also want to operator-unlock your phone, you&amp;#8217;ll need ultrasn0w. This is the replacement for the long-lived yellowsn0w. In case you weren&amp;#8217;t aware of this fact, the new baseband has a hole again, which allows for it to be hacked. This way, we can all use different operator SIM cards without a problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  To install ultrasn0w, you simply need to add the repo http://repo666.ultrasn0w.com and then search and install the application ultrasn0w on Cydia. Reboot your phone, and you&amp;#8217;re done. It really is THAT easy!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So what are you waiting for? Go for it!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/username&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Was Windows Vista a mistake? Not really!</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  With the advent of Microsoft&amp;#8217;s latest operating system, the Windows 7, many people have come to state that Windows 7 is Windows Vista &lt;a href=&quot;http://jmm.aaa.net.au/articles/22533.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;done&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/biztech/windows-7-its-vista-done-right/2009/05/04/1241289099764.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;right&lt;/a&gt;. Well, excuse me tech whizzes but as an IT professional myself, I beg to differ.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Windows Vista was a massive stepping stone in Microsoft&amp;#8217;s history. It was the first upgrade from the ever so loved Windows XP, that admittedly had its flaws at birth but it grew to become perhaps the most stable operating system that Microsoft had built until then. It is lightweight and to prove that we have the netbook market share that is dominated by Microsoft.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Now, we have to be analytic. What did Vista bring to the table when compared to XP? In a very brief and sketchy approach, it brought cleanliness to the user folders (no one really liked the spaces in &amp;#8216;Documents and Settings&amp;#8217;), it brought UAC that albeit poorly-loved, it brought with it a great layer of security, it brought some driver modifications including a redesigned sound-stack and these last two put together with the bloated memory usage, made Vista Microsoft&amp;#8217;s bastard child.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Well, when you look at it closely, pretty much every Vista driver will work on Windows 7, including the soundcard drivers. UAC is also part of Windows 7 and has been partly redesigned so that it isn&amp;#8217;t so naggy. Still, my bottom line is that when switching from XP, Microsoft was always going to get complaints. When you add security, people will complain because the system is more restrictive. When you add features that change the way people interface with the computer, people will complain because we have an inertial nature and are typically against change.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  However, now that Vista was Microsoft&amp;#8217;s escape goat for all the changes that simply had to be made, Windows 7 can come in its shinning armour and save the day. Because Windows 7 is so much better than Vista, even though it&amp;#8217;s actually Vista, just lighter.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Google Summer of Code &amp;#8211; Payments Rolling In</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yep, the title says it all. Today I have received my shiny new VISA from Citibank with the initial $505 loaded on it. The other kewl stuff in the envelope included a neat, Google-branded, moleskin and two GSoC 2009 stickers. One’s going on my laptop, if I can gut it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I’ll leave you with some photos now!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Mozilla Mystery</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Howdy readers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I bring you one of the long time mysteries for me. Why in heavens does Mozilla insist on making different menus for Firefox and Thunderbird depending on whether you’re using it on Linux or Windows? Seriously, I just can’t figure out the reason for this… the Options menu sits in the Tools toolbar in Windows, whereas in the Linux version, it goes under Edit. But WHY?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Till the next time!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Master&amp;#8217;s Degree</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-190 aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;unilogo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/unilogo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;unilogo&quot; width=&quot;184&quot; height=&quot;50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Alright people, this is really happening 😀 . Today, I got the final acceptance letter from Leicester&amp;#8217;s Postgraduate Department. They provided me with a conditional offer where the only condition is that I finish my degree with at least 65% of overall grade average. This is totally feasible since my grade average, last I checked, was of 14 marks in a 20-point scale, which rounds to roughly 70% in a loose conversion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Cool, hey? 😀 Now let&amp;#8217;s just hope those money leechs at the bank will loan me the money I need!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Just on a little background, I&amp;#8217;ll be taking the Advanced Software Engineering (MSc) course at the University of Leicester, with a start date of September 28th 2009. When I&amp;#8217;m done, I&amp;#8217;ll finally be a jack of all trades and a Master of Advanced Software Engineering 🙂
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Office 2007 SP2 reduces interoperability &amp;#8211; tough luck?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Allison over at ZDNet has just posted an &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=18317&amp;amp;tag=nl.e539&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; where in a nutshell he states that Microsoft broke the interoperability of the ODF format between Office 2007 and other implementations of this format. According to this gentleman, the guys over at Microsoft are mean little bastards because &lt;strong&gt;they implemented the ODF standard&lt;/strong&gt; verbatim. Whoa, whoa, whoa little Timmy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last I checked, there was a war going on towards Microsoft because they were mean chauvinistic bastards who insisted on not making Internet Explorer more standards compliant, because the standards were the way to go and anything other than the standards just breaks pages on browsers that implement the standard. I totally agree with this point, but by the same measure, I have to disagree with this ODF quarrel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With SP2, Microsoft implemented the ODF specification to its fullest. Then there are other implementations like OpenOffice’s that have additions to the specification, but that aren’t part of the standard! Yet, it is Microsoft that people come out to the streets to criticize, and not the people who engineered a poorly designed standard. Please, don’t take me wrong. I am also against OOXML, but that doesn’t mean that the alternatives are perfect and perhaps Microsoft is just proving a point amongst narrow-minded people who don’t care for a little reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want spreadsheets to properly support formulas in ODF? Make it part of the friggin’ standard! Don’t expect Microsoft to deviate from the standard for interop’s sake, especially now when you have before criticized the company for not being standards-compliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bottom-line is: who is to decide whether a standard should be implemented in a strict manner or not? And to which extent should interop efforts be made? All in all, if Microsoft designs interoperability towards OpenOffice, it might just break things with another Office Suite that decided to implement things differently.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The First Flaw in Windows 7</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hold your horses, this isn’t a flaw per se. There isn’t a massive hole in Windows 7 that allows the execution of malicious code. Instead, there’s a legacy feature that has been around ever since Windows 98 (maybe even 95, but that I do not know for sure) that is used by virus writers to fool users into executing their viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feature I am talking about is the ability to hide the extension for known file types. This comes enabled by default on XP and Vista and it was not addressed in Windows 7. Basically, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=4317&amp;amp;tag=nl.e550&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Adrian over at ZDNet&lt;/a&gt; reports, with this feature enabled, a file with ‘double extension’ can easily be fooled for its fake extention. For example, a file named Report.txt.exe will automatically have the ‘.exe’ extension hidden, and to the eyes of the less computer-savvy it can easily be mistaken for an innocent Report.txt file. Moreso when the creator of the virus is careful enough to add an innocent notepad icon to the malevolent application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be perfectly honest, I agree with Adrian. This is a feature that I disable right after I install Windows. More often than not I find myself having to change the extension of a file, and it’s impossible to do so with this feature enabled and without resorting to the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature is dangerous and it has been the gateway for many viruses to spread. Adrian also suggests adding some sort of overlay to the icons of executable files that aren’t digitally signed – this is an incredibly good idea. Maybe something glarey as the icons of running applications on the new Windows 7 start bar. If properly done, this could be flashey and would cause a good impression on end-users, both visually and safety-wise. Personally, I would remove the feature altogether and leave it off – and please, without the possibility of working around it on the registry – but that’s just my two pennies worth of opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ethical Hacking</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;‘Times are a changing’ – nowadays more than ever this is true. Companies and individuals rely more and more on the Internet and let’s be honest: the Internet is not a safe place, not by a slim chance. I’m not even talking about viruses, which on their own are a pretty big threat. What I am going on about are hackers. You know, the evil guys who want all your money and your credit card numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t take it personally, no hacker has a grudge especially against you or your company, but unless you take preemptive measures to be on the front line, then you are at risk. There is a chance that you are at risk right now. This is the sort of thing where you cannot possibly think “this only happens to other people” – well, think again, it happened to electrical power plants in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you convinced that you need to do something about it yet? I hope you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s the whole idea you ask? Well, the idea is being ahead of the hackers, it is thinking like an hacker so that you can be preemptive and patch the holes in your organization. Do you know how store-owners set up motion sensors near windows that can easily be broken? The idea here is just the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept is called ethical hacking. You are taught on the ways, tricks and subterfuges of hackers so that you can have a different insight on your company. Believe it or not, but the biggest flaw in computer systems is actually us, the users. We are easily duped and deceived by people pretending to be who they aren’t, and this has reached astronomical levels. The most blatant case nowadays is when you get an e-mail that pretends to be a legitimate e-mail from your bank, from a work-mate or simply people who would be innocently sending you pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well my fellow Internauts, no enough care is much care these days. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://iclass.eccouncil.org/&quot;&gt;EC-Council&lt;/a&gt; provides you with the security training that you need not only to help yourself and your company, but also to help other companies. This of course is an investment that can get a return flowing in so in the end, it is all benefits! This isn’t all; if you are trained in &lt;a href=&quot;http://socialspark.com/metrics/click/post?slot_id=36484&amp;#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Furlbrief.com%2F98d904&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;IT Security&lt;/a&gt;, your job opportunities simply tenfold. Is that not what everyone wants at a time of recession and crisis?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iClass by the EC-Council has the following categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Security Fundamentals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Ethical Hacking &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Penetration Testing &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Computer Forensics  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Disaster Recovery &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Secure Programming&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So whether you are a newbie (hey, there’s no shame about that!) and you need the fundamentals, or whether you fancy a job at a crime lab doing scientific forensics for a living, the iClass covers it all. You just take your pick!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested, and here’s hoping that you won’t miss this great opportunity, then here are some links that will help you on the EC-Council site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Program Site:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>LG KM900 &amp;#8211; You&amp;#8217;re doing it wrong</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the newest &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.lge.com/products/model/detail/mobilephones_lgarena(km900).jhtml&quot;&gt;LG KM900&lt;/a&gt; is released, I can’t help the thought: LG, you’re doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I do not feel motivated to write about this phone simply because it is not aimed at mainstream; whoever tells me otherwise is clearly missing on the whole point. Put it this way, a phone isn’t really just a phone anymore these days. The market requires customisable and flexible phones, such phones that can be expanded. What is the point of having a next-gen, touch-screen phone if afterwards you can’t extend it with third-party applications and functionality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my humble opinion, it is safe to say that nowadays, a phone without:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Windows Mobile&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Symbian OS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) iPhone OS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is just doomed to extinction and failure. I know I wouldn’t buy anything outside that. (I am a proud owner of an iPhone 3G by the way)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Windows 7 RC out &amp;#8211; maybe</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright ladies and gentlemen, the announcement is out: the first (and hopefully only) Release Candidate of the newest, mind blowing, operating system from the folks at Redmond is out. Or is it really? There’s a Microsoft Partners’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://partner.microsoft.com/US/40084742&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; announcing the event and I say that that’s as reliable as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to said page, the RC should be available right now for MSDN and TechNet subscribers but well… it ain’t. The same page also announces that a global (and I guess, public) release will be done on May 5th which is actually pretty close in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess is that we just sit and wait, and that within the day, this RC will be made available on the MSDN downloads page. Or so I hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this release is more coherent with Ed Bott’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=751&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;speculative timeline&lt;/a&gt; over at ZDNet which places the Windows 7 RTM release on late August of 2009. At this point, we just wait and see – being a 7 Beta user, I am happy and borderline ecstatic to get a RC release so soon. Way to go, Microsoft!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Google Summer of Code 2009</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I know this post comes a little late and all but I still had to mention it on my blog. It turns out I am repeating the stunt again. After being turned down by Google last year, I decided I would try to apply once more this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since last year I still had the change to get acquainted and get the logic of &lt;a href=&quot;http://db.apache.org/derby/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apache Derby&lt;/a&gt;, I thought it would be wise to apply for the same project, and so I did. After all I do have an education on database management and also on Java, which are key for a project like Apache Derby. On top of it all there’s also my tutor from last year; despite not having been chosen I still had a tutor who helped me all the way through. Kathey Marsden agreed to be my tutor again this year and that is a plus for me because I know upfront what I can expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the application period is over and my application is submitted. The results should be out on April 20th and I have my fingers crossed for me to get picked 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>VMWare Unity &amp;#8211; The ultimate virtualization?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Would it not be cool to have two operating systems interweaved in the same machine in a seamless manner? What if you could be running Ubuntu and alongside with its ‘normal’ windows, you could just have your favourite Windows applications running as if they were running natively? It would be awesome, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if this is still an utopia for you, then you are probably missing out on VMWare’s Unity functionality, available since the version 6.5 on their Workstation platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s Unity you ask? I say it is the best damn thing ever invented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unity, as I have hinted, gives you the ability of having the applications of a guest operating system ‘running under’ the host OS. I used quotes because in actual fact, only the windows from those apps are transported from the guest to the host – all the applications will still be running under the guest OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in practice, you can be running Ubuntu (or any other flavour of Linux) and have Adobe’s Photoshop or Microsoft Word running &lt;strong&gt;right there&lt;/strong&gt;, alongside Gnometrix or any other of the applications that you can run under Linux. The opposite also works. As a matter of fact, I’m running Vista as we speak and I am developing under Netbeans on Ubuntu. Neat eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot begin to address the multitude of possibilities that this opens. It is still buggy but even when you have applications that still can’t run on Vista, you can just have a virtual machine running XP and your applications can run straight off along the other windows. It’s just the ultimate invention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll leave you with a printscreen since an image is worth a thousand words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-165&quot; title=&quot;vistabuntu&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/vistabuntu-300x168.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;vistabuntu&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;168&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/vistabuntu-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/vistabuntu-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/vistabuntu.jpg 1366w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What&amp;#8217;s hot?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am certainly not. My life’s about to get shaken up a little and I am going from idleness to a rather busy period, or so I believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I have decided I will be applying once more for Google Summer of Code. I applied last year and sadly, didn’t get approved. Still, I stuck around an open source project and actually got to do some work on it. The experience was invaluable and I am going for the very same project again. My experience will be a plus and I really am looking forward to be part of GSoC’09.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I am having to do research for my final school project: analyzing and proofing the eXplicit Control Protocol (XCP). As exciting as it may sound, it gets a little demotivating when the true goals of our project are, to say the least, blurry. Still, I am aiming to do the best I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still on my thought currently are two school subjects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Decision Support Systems – The labs on this subject are turning out quite interesting. The definition of DSS &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; interesting and it is fascinating to get your hands dirty with data warehouses and with extreme load scenarios. The theory however is kinda boring and dull…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Enterprise Information Systems – Good ole SAP. It looks like this subject will be extremely intensive and will require a lot of work but it is certainly a nice challenge. Having SAP in my CV will also be a massive stepping stone for the future as SAP consultants are not only &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; well paid, but the position is also always in constant demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the near future I also have some extra-curricular plans. I have volunteered to be part of the FITEC event, so that should be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s all folks! I better go get some sle…..get back to work I mean! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Accelero Twin Turbo by Artic Cooling &amp;#8211; Review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I had been having a problem. My graphics card (a humble PowerColor HD4850) was overheating to smithereens. Each time I wanted to play a game I would manually pump up the only small fan, increasing the noise tenfold, only to keep the temperature at a scorching 100ºC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you read correctly. Under load (running Team Fortress 2) this card would easily reach the 100 degrees Celsius. The funny thing about it? It wouldn’t absolutely stutter at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having done research on it, I came to the conclusion that this card was simply &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.overclock.net/ati/347689-hd4850-heat-problem-hot-do-i.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hot by nature&lt;/a&gt;. Or, better put, the stock cooler is not appropriate for the kind of heat this graphics card generates. There is being hot and there is not having appropriate cooling. This case is most certainly the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My results, despite not having screenshots of it, were of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– 80ºC idle (with the fan at 40% – which is the maximum I was willing to go noise-wise)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– 100ºC ++ load (with the fan at 80% and a deafening noise that even got my mom scared about it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, while the card was most certainly designed with this sort of temperatures in mind, heat rarely does any good to electrical components. When we’re talking about temperatures enough to make your kettle whistle, then you know you should do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I bought the Accelero Twin Turbo and at first I was a little reluctant. I was afraid it was just going to be more of the same as the stock cooler, with little improvement. I couldn’t have been more wrong. The installation is pretty straight-forward, although, to its own right, the RAM and voltage regulators heatsinks definitely could use more glue. With a little nudge I managed to remove one of the heatsinks so I am still wondering how they will hold up through time (literally).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cooler packs quite a punch when compared to the stock cooler. It comes with two 80mm fans, attached to a massive aluminum block, which has a copper pipeline system that goes straight to the actual block that attaches to the GPU. Keep in mind that space may be an issue with this cooler; if you are going for CrossFire then think again about buying the Twin Turbo as your graphics card will use up THREE slots on the back of your computer case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is crazy, I know, but right now I have the same 40% setting on the fans (this cooler is pluggable to your graphics’ card fan power supply) and I get a cool 33ºC . While gaming, it never goes above the 36ºC and that is with the very same 40% !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as noise goes, it can’t even compare to the stock cooler, which is actually expectable. There is a trade-off between the size of a fan, the amount of air it can move per second and the noise in decibels it produces. Basically, with a bigger fan, you can move the same (or a bigger) amount of air with the same (or less) noise. These two fans are really silent, barely audible. If I push them to 100% then you actually start to hear them, but at 100% they are less audible than the single, stock fan, at 80%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you still needed any proof that this is the cooler for you, look no further. This will solve ALL your temperature problems and I advocate that this graphics card should actually come with one of these coolers by default.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gmail now has customizable themes &amp;#8211; what about us?!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;That’s right, what about us, Google Apps users?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google has recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/02/choose-your-own-theme-colors.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;released means&lt;/a&gt; for people to customize the looks of their GMail inboxes, but we, Google Apps users, are still in the blue. (That’s my poor attempt at a pun)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since Theming was released for GMail that I have been waiting and hoping to get the very same feature for Google Apps. After all, some of the G. Apps users are paying users, so one would expect the guys at Google to roll out the new features fairly quickly for their Apps users. That has not been the case. It was not the case with IMAP and it was not the case with Google Labs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now once more, it is not the case with Themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, you can throw out all the excuses that there are a lot of users and that it needs a lot of work to roll out the features to everyone, but that just doesn’t stick with me. Even recently we (Apps users) got our default theme changed to the default theme brought by the theming feature, however, the Themes tab is still MIA on the Settings page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, part of the code has already been rolled out, but not all of it. The why is yet to be known, as Google won’t give anything more than “soon, Themes will come to Google Apps”. But how soon, Google?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PasteBins &amp;#8211; Usenet 2.0</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Here I am again with a crazy project of mine: HaxTools.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Ok, the name wasn&amp;#8217;t particularly well thought but I think you will find the idea quite well engineered.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  On a little background note, let me introduce you to Usenet. Usenet started off in 1979 as a forum-like service. It was a discussion board were allowed to discuss and share opinions, very much like forums as we know them nowadays. Instead of using your webclient, you would have to use an e-mail client with support for NNTP (the newsgroups protocol) or an actual application dedicated to newsgroups, this means that this service, unlike forums, doesn&amp;#8217;t work over HTTP but over a different protocol, NNTP.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  What happened after was that people realized the potential of the newsgroup servers for other purposes, namely file distributing based on a centralized server (as opposed to peer-to-peer). Such newsgroup servers are most commonly provided over very powerful Internet backbones which makes them great platforms for distributing all kinds of binary files to several people just at the cost of one single upload.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  And so it started happening. Programs were developed that were able to post binary files on newsgroups, and newsgroup clients that were able to download binary files also started showing up. From posting innocent files to using Usenet as a gateway for piracy was quite a small leap and nowadays one could say that the Usenet is perhaps most used for illegal content than for actual discussion of ideas.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Now, back to my application. HaxTools is a proof of concept set of tools; therefore, I won&amp;#8217;t be liable for any damage it causes to your computer or to &lt;strong&gt;whatever&lt;/strong&gt; uses people give it. In principle, the program does not violate any terms of service, although it is likely that the service it uses currently (http://rafb.net/paste/) will get up measures to fight it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  My application makes use of PasteBin sites (like the RAFB.net) to store files online. The HaxUploader allows you to choose the granularity of the upload up to 500Kb (meaning that your file will be sliced in 500Kb pieces) and allows files of up to 10Mb &amp;#8211; this limit is in place so that your computer doesn&amp;#8217;t crash. This is just because I had no concern with optimization, so all operations are done in memory, which can be cumbersome on the computer for big files. However, optimizations can indeed be made so that all operations are done out of the hard drive, making the process slower but workable for bigger files. Depending on the success of this proof of concept, I may get into optimizing the idea.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  How does it work from a user&amp;#8217;s perspective?&lt;br /&gt; Nothing simpler. The user chooses a file on HaxUploader, presses upload and waits until the green bar gets filled completely and links show up on the box below. When the links are there, you just have to copy the said links (&lt;strong&gt;don&amp;#8217;t ever change the order!&lt;/strong&gt;) and distribute them to other people.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  From the receiver&amp;#8217;s perspective, they will open HaxDownloader, paste in the links on the &lt;strong&gt;SAME&lt;/strong&gt; order as they have received them and press Download. After a while, a message will appear saying that the process was completed; at this point, on the same folder as HaxDownloader was ran, there will be a NewFile.bin &amp;#8211; this is the standard name for all downloaded files. Afterwards you&amp;#8217;ll have to rename it to whatever you like and also keep in mind that you do have to change the extension of the file to what it was originally &amp;#8211; this is also something that could be done better in an actual program.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After that is done, your file is ready to use. Whether it is a RAR file, or an MP3&amp;#8230; whatever, it will work with all file types and we&amp;#8217;ll now get to how it works from the code&amp;#8217;s perspective.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  What&amp;#8217;s the whole idea? In a nutshell, the HaxUploader grabs the file it is meant to upload, streams it into memory (treating it as a binary file, thus working for any kind of files) and then moves on to convert the file contents to Base64. This is the standard format on which files are stored on Usenet; so the core idea is kept. With the contents on Base64, it goes on to split them into smaller chunks (given by the granularity setting) and uploads each of the chunks into a separate &amp;#8216;pasting&amp;#8217;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  When it has finally submitted all the parts and acquired all the links from the &amp;#8216;pastings&amp;#8217; we&amp;#8217;re all done and it simply outputs the links to the user.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The order in which the links are arranged does matter and it is imperative that they are kept in the order they are provided to you, otherwise it simply won&amp;#8217;t work as I haven&amp;#8217;t put in place any order measure. (It can be done though and on an actual application this would be needed).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The Downloader program simply fetches the content of the paste links, puts it all back together and decodes the Base64 string into binary, recreating the file.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  As a final note, there isn&amp;#8217;t a big deal of protections and validations in place, that is why this is a proof of concept &amp;#8211; I just wanted to prove that it can be done.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  For now I am not releasing the source code but just the binaries. If you are interested in the source code, you can contact me at tiago[at]espinhas[dot]net and we can discuss the situation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Until the next time!
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Apple could do (and doesn&amp;#8217;t) to have the upper hand at Microsoft</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Howdy everyone,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I was thinking the other day (yes, this does happen every now and then) and something hit me: what is the big issue with developing any kind of software these days? Optimization, right? This is truer on a special case and I am refering to the operating systems. Windows, Mac OS, Linux-based&amp;#8230; you know the drill.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Optimization is by nature, a very herculean task, especially when you are developing a piece of software to run on a wide variety of platforms and environments. Sure, some of the most recent computers come with dual-core CPUs, but pretty much all operating systems &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; still be able to operate on single-core processors, just as they have to be able to handle 4 or 8 cores effectively. This is not only true in the case of processors but also on RAM. If an operating system is running on 256Mb of RAM, it must certainly behave differently resource-wise than it will behave on a system with 4Gb of available RAM. More to the point, what is the use of having 4Gb of RAM, if 3Gb stay unused at all times? One could argue that having available memory is good because it allows the applications to use more as they need it, without resorting to swap files, but for the most part it is wasted memory, a precious resource in our computers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  With this said, for companies like Microsoft, it certainly is hard to develop an operating system that will efficiently handle old and new, resource-limited and resource-boasted platforms, simply because they create Windows for a variety of hardware. Windows will run on AMD, Intel and VIA and although they all are x86-based, there are certain instructions, that could be used to optimize but are not, because if my Core 2 Duo has SSE4, my friend&amp;#8217;s Athlon XP 3000+ hasn&amp;#8217;t got this set of instructions and therefore an application optimized for my CPU won&amp;#8217;t actually run on his.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This is, to some extent, the story of Windows Vista. Windows Vista brought quite a few innovations when compared to XP but it had a problem: if your resources are on the lower end, your computer will feel like a sloth on a lazy day and XP feels like cool breeze when compared to Vista. However, if you have ever had the chance to try out Vista on a powerful system, you&amp;#8217;ll be in awe simply because it will feel as fast as XP and you have all the goodies. Windows 7 by the way, is set to change this, but let us keep that to a different post as that is off-subject.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So, what is the main characteristic of a Macintosh computer? Until very recently, they used hardware unlike that of PCs but not anymore, their hardware is now similar and compatible with PC hardware. Actually, its parts are normal PC parts, with Intel CPUs and Intel/Nvidia/ATI graphics cards so what is really different? It&amp;#8217;s simple: they come assembled and are not meant to be disassembled at the risk of getting your warranty voided.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  My point is that if Apple keeps such a high-standard on their computers and keeps them so expensive, why not turn the competition knob a notch? Pack their computers with like 8Gb of RAM at least and with 1Tb hard drives. In a way, Apple has started optimizing since Mac OS 10.5 will only run on at least the Core 2 Duo platform and this is a good thing, but I still think that RAM is a major factor in computers that is being systematically (and wrongly) left behind. However, if you have 8Gb of RAM, you could almost reserve 4Gb just for pre-fetching most used applications &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; the user needs them, and still have plenty of RAM for the average user to mess with. Maybe we need to go big and supersize and make a break with the past of computing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  What is the real problem? Not knowing in advance when and how much RAM the user will need. So if an operating system starts using all the available (free) memory to pre-fetch applications, if at some point the user needs an application that requires, say, 512Mb of RAM and that program wasn&amp;#8217;t pre-fetched, the OS will have to quickly ditch 512Mb of that pre-fetch RAM and quickly load that program into memory. The problem? This can&amp;#8217;t happen quickly because the program will be loaded from the hard drive and the hard drive is inherently slow.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Effectively, the memory allocation algorithm has to have something like a behaviour analysis module. Something that records the user behaviour and finds patterns, and even then it has to give room for the unexpected. A good memory allocation algorithm isn&amp;#8217;t the key to all of the problems though, if for instance there isn&amp;#8217;t enough RAM available, then an algorithm can&amp;#8217;t make miracles no matter how good it is.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  To finish my post: Apple can control both their software and hardware, as the Portuguese saying goes &amp;#8220;they have the knife and the cheese&amp;#8221; so I sincerely feel that they can do way much more for their users in terms of performance. I do reckon that Mac OS users do not typically complain about performance, but what is also true on a computer is that it can always be faster.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>GMail has a new security flaw</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  That&amp;#8217;s right folks GMail has a massive security hole which, to the extent of my knowledge, remains unpatched. Aibek at MakeUseOf.com has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/breaking-gmail-security-flaw-more-domains-get-stollen/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thoroughly explained&lt;/a&gt; what happened to him and to others, and if you are really curious about the detauks, then it is definitely worth checking out.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I will, in a brief and resumed way, describe the situation and what you can do to play it safe(r).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  What happens is that through a trick with URLs and attacking websites, an attacker can effectively enable your e-mail forwarding to whichever e-mail the said attacker wants to. Basically, this way, they get access to all your incoming e-mail because it gets forwarded to their inbox.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  In Aibek&amp;#8217;s case, the attacker managed to somehow steal the e-mail that contained the password to access his domain registrar account. The attacker then transfered the domain to another registrar and started to blackmail Aibek, claiming that he wanted $2000 for the domain that he originally owned.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This is a very serious situation, and maybe this is just the tip of the iceberg; a lot of malicious actions can be conducted this way and the first and foremost thing you should do right now if you own a GMail account, is to check under Settings -&amp;gt; &amp;#8220;Forwarding and POP/IMAP&amp;#8221; if your forwarding is set to some unknown address. If it is, then you are highly advised to disable the forwarding and &lt;strong&gt;change all your passwords&lt;/strong&gt;. Especially if you have received e-mails from password recovery systems that you didn&amp;#8217;t ask for in the first place.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The next tip is to never open links that come within e-mails that you don&amp;#8217;t totally trust. If you must open the link anyway, then rather than clicking it, copy the link, logout from your GMail account and then visit the link. When you&amp;#8217;re done, log back in and you should be safe.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  It is yet to be known if this flaw affects Google Apps accounts as well. In a wild guess I would say it does, but it would have to be customized to attack a specific domain belonging to Google Apps, so everyone, be wary.
&lt;/p&gt;

  Yep, that is right indeed, I have one of such babies. Privileges of being a Microsoft Student Partner huh? It does have its downturns as well though, such as when I go out of my house, there&amp;#8217;s a massive crowd waiting to get my autograph and to interview me&amp;#8230; (not really&amp;#8230;)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  But that&amp;#8217;s just it, just wanted to share my shiny new subscriptor card with you readers and have you envy it. Yes, now I have Vista Ultimate for free, and who knows, maybe Windows 7 too, when it gets out&amp;#8230; 😉
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  My apologies for having gone through a period without posting at all but, my life has been undergoing some maintenance (all for good, I assure you! but won&amp;#8217;t get into specifics) and therefore I haven&amp;#8217;t been coming here as often as I would like. This is however going to change and so, expect to see more regular posting from now on.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  See you soon!

        <title>Apple&amp;#8217;s quality center puts the B in Dumn</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;No, it’s not a typo at all. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/20/apples-new-macbook-is-mm-mm-goo/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apparently&lt;/a&gt;, Apple forgot the “B” key in their new Macbook laptops. So much for your high quality standards Steve Jobs…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Windows 7 goes official</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;That’s right, this will after all be the official name of the next Windows version. According to Mike Nash on the Windows Vista &lt;a href=&quot;http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2008/10/13/introducing-windows-7.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft is sticking with the simple name Windows 7, therefore cutting with the “aspirational monikers” that they have used in the past like Windows XP or Vista.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same person writes that this is the seventh release of Windows, hence the naming Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3777686&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; tells us that a pre-beta version of this new Windows will be distributed at the Professional Developer Conference, set to take place on Los Angeles on October 27th.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A personal view at Firefox vs. Chrome</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So, really, now that the hype is over, what is the browser of choice? Well, the out of the box answer for me is Firefox but let&amp;#8217;s have a deeper look at the contest shall we?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  What plays in favour of Google Chrome?&lt;br /&gt; I for one really enjoyed the looks. It has a clean and sleek interface without your regular toolbar menus and without a caption bar. I find this amazing. It&amp;#8217;s the first browser that was designed with true usability in mind regarding the menu paraphernalia. The guys at Google really are being serious about seeing websites as actual applications, and proof of that is the fact that you can create &amp;#8220;application links&amp;#8221;. This also plays in Chrome&amp;#8217;s favour in my opinion. There are pages that I simply have open at all times and ones that I have to be able to access quickly; Google Chrome with this feature allows me to run GMail (or any other website) as a separate window, simply by leaving an icon on my desktop. This separate window is also special, it has kind of usability on steroids since it has no menu whatsoever. It does have a caption, which in this case is good because I might want to move the window around while not maximized.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Ok, now that we&amp;#8217;re done talking about the user interface, we go on to the actual features. For starters, let&amp;#8217;s face it: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=2507&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Chrome is &lt;strong&gt;fast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Actually, it feels faster than Firefox as far as browsing is concerned. How do they achieve it? I&amp;#8217;m not exactly sure and if my suspicions are right, you can probably achieve the same effect with &lt;a href=&quot;http://fasterfox.mozdev.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FasterFox&lt;/a&gt; or with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ghacks.net/2007/03/29/10-tips-to-speed-up-opera-9/trackback/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;properly configured&lt;/a&gt; Opera, but I&amp;#8217;m dealing with the facts here and that is that Chrome feels fast.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  There is also a technical choice in Chrome that pleased me greatly, in part I&amp;#8217;m amazed that such a big open-source project like Mozilla Firefox, packed with paranoid security people let something like this go through on Firefox. The choice I&amp;#8217;m talking about is the fact that Chrome spawns different processes for each tab whereas Firefox uses a threading system instead. It is common programming knowledge that when it comes to security, processes are by far much safer than threads, not to mention the advantages regarding memory management. Why, you ask? Memory leaks. This isn&amp;#8217;t just some buzz word that came with Firefox, this is an actual problem that Firefox and many more applications suffer from. What is a memory leak? Again, to put it simply, it&amp;#8217;s memory of your system that was reserved but that wasn&amp;#8217;t marked as free when it was no longer needed. So if a browser eats 100Mb of your RAM, and when you, say, close a tab it does not free the resources that belonged to that tab, then the more tabs you open, the more memory the browser will be using, and it can only use ever so much. How does multiprocessing help prevent this? It&amp;#8217;s simple: since each tab runs in its own process, when the process dies (i.e. the tab is closed), the memory that was assigned to it gets released &lt;em&gt;automagically. &lt;/em&gt;So even as far as plugins are concerned (to name a few: Flash, Silverligh, Acrobat Reader&amp;#8230;the list goes on), even if those are leaking memory, which has happened in the past, it will all be contained as soon as the tab is closed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  In practical terms, you open up Firefox and note down how much memory its using. Then browse for 6 hours in a row without closing and reopening the browser. Still, you open tabs, browse in those tabs, close some tabs, open up new ones and do some browsing following this procedure. Also, do visit some Flash-powered websites, and do view some PDF documents in-browser. In the end, close all the tabs but one, it can even be a blank, newly opened, tab. Now open your Task Manager and check how much memory Firefox is using. Note it down and do the same with Google Chrome. See what I&amp;#8217;m talking about? I&amp;#8217;m no future teller but Firefox will be using much memory after the 6 hours than it was in the beginning, and that is memory leaks plus memory fragmentation kicking in (which is also tameable by using processes instead of threads).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Something else that I find great about Chrome is its OmniBar. I had loved Firefox&amp;#8217;s Awesome Bar but OmniBar throws us to a completely different level of browsing. For instance it cuts off the need for two input boxes like Firefox has, since this address bar can do both automatic searching and regular browsing. Way to go Google. As of yet, I&amp;#8217;m still trying to find a Firefox plugin that perfectly mimics OmniBar&amp;#8217;s behaviour.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The incognito mode is also a neat little feature, specially when you are on public computers (or visiting sites that you should not be visiting&amp;#8230;..). This is something that has also been included on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/beta/default.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Internet Explorer 8&lt;/a&gt; (InPrivate) but apparently is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnetasia.com/news/security/0,39044215,62042653,00.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;yet to be announced&lt;/a&gt; on Firefox, even if I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure that there&amp;#8217;s already some addon out there that serves the same purpose.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Lastly there&amp;#8217;s the download management. Chrome&amp;#8217;s way of handling downloads is far from perfect, but I still like it better than that of Firefox. I really dislike having a separate window in my task pane just for downloads. It&amp;#8217;s a real pain in the rear when you&amp;#8217;re using the feature on Windows that allows you to group windows of the same application. I think there is still some work needed on this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Now, for the not-so-good things about Chrome.&lt;br /&gt; The spell checker. For God&amp;#8217;s sake, I still cannot believe that you cannot change the spell checker language without having to restart the whole browser! And even more, you have to crawl through the menus to achieve that. Thank you Firefox for allowing me to do that on the context menu.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The lack of extendibility. Unfortunately, Google Chrome still does not support plugins or addons, nor does it support themes. A shame really, specially because it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem like it&amp;#8217;s something that it&amp;#8217;s being worked upon, since their policy seems to be simplicity. This is kind of both good and bad.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  It&amp;#8217;s still &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; beta. There&amp;#8217;s features missing (print selected text anyone?), it&amp;#8217;s still kinda buggy and well, it still needs a lot of work. As an advantage is the fact that it&amp;#8217;s an open-source project, meaning that if there are bugs, there&amp;#8217;s a high likeliness that the community will find and report them, and when those bugs are security-critical, this is a massive advantage over closed-source projects.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I also feel that Chrome&amp;#8217;s password management is less intuitive and neat than Firefox&amp;#8217;s. Maybe I&amp;#8217;ve just grown used to the way Firefox handles things. I don&amp;#8217;t really know.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I believe I have in one way or another, covered out everything on both browsers, at least the things that affect me directly. There is a specific addon for Firefox that I cannot go without, that is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxmarks.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Foxmarks&lt;/a&gt;. This addon allows me to share bookmarks across several computers, and I simply cannot get anything like it on Google Chrome, which is sad really. I keep a toolbar with my neatly organized bookmarks and if they aren&amp;#8217;t coherent across all my computers, then it defeats the purpose of having it there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  There&amp;#8217;s another topic on the «browser-war» that I would like to address here: memory usage. No, I&amp;#8217;m not going to show screenshots or make videos of how Firefox uses less or more memory than Chrome, or anything like it. For ages, we&amp;#8217;ve been living on the edge of a good program translating into a program that uses little memory. Nowadays this is a &lt;strong&gt;VERY&lt;/strong&gt; wrong concept. In the early days, the RAM memory available was scarce and sometimes we had to make the craziest juggles to even play certain games. Today, we typically have more RAM memory than we can handle; memory which just sits there on our computer, idling. Now, think for a minute: what good is it to have free memory? Yeah, sure it prevents the computer for using the swap file since there&amp;#8217;s always free memory for that one application you&amp;#8217;ve just started but hold on for a second. The RAM is extremely fast when compared to your hard drive, so populating the RAM with data that might be handy in the near future is a measure that will for sure make your computer feel faster. If resources for a certain application are being loaded from the RAM rather than from the hard-drive, you will notice that the application runs faster.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So I think you see where I am getting here? I don&amp;#8217;t really mind if browser X uses more RAM when compared to browser Y, as long as that RAM is being put to good use. That is, as long as that memory is being used to make the application run faster.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Firefox actually has a go at this but the Mozilla guys kind of failed. Firefox does use a ton of memory but it&amp;#8217;s far from being used to enhance speed, it&amp;#8217;s basically memory that gets left over and forgotten about. Since Firefox runs in one single process, this also builds up memory fragmentation within the process, which just adds up to the RAM being wasted mindlessly. The idea of fragmentation is as follows: say that you have 3 tabs. The first is using 20Mb of your RAM, the second is using 5Mb and the third is using 15Mb and also assume that they were opened by this order, thus they are ordered like that in the process&amp;#8217; memory space (it&amp;#8217;s much more complex than this, but for this purpose we can simplify it like that). Then you decide that the second tab (the one with 5Mb) is no longer needed and you close it. Tada, you just have created a hole in your memory. Firefox &lt;strong&gt;won&amp;#8217;t&lt;/strong&gt; reorganize the memory assignments just to fill the gap with the existing tabs, set aside the operating system doing that.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Now there are two scenarios:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#8211; You open a tab that by default uses up 10Mb and therefore it won&amp;#8217;t fit the gap. (You are wasting the 5Mb that despite being free, they can&amp;#8217;t be used by whatever else that requires more space)&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#8211; You open a tab that starts up at 2Mb, and as you browse on it, it grows to 15Mb. Then you&amp;#8217;ll have fragmentation. Part of your tab&amp;#8217;s data will be on that gap, and the rest will be somewhere else.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Either scenario is undesirable and also avoidable with processes instead of tabs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  But hey, I&amp;#8217;m going to stop hitting the same key, it&amp;#8217;s just that apparently Mozilla has pushed this notion way down on their priority stack and this is just foolish. I&amp;#8217;m sure it will take a lot of work to switch from threads to processes, but it will be really worth it in the end.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The last remark on the two browsers&lt;br /&gt; There&amp;#8217;s a new fight going on right now which is the Javascript fight. Google and Mozilla seem to be going head-to-head trying to make their Javascript engine be the fastest one. Truth is that when you compare Google Chrome (any version) to Mozilla Firefox (up until 3.1.0 which is still due to be released), Chrome simply is &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10030888-92.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;much faster&lt;/a&gt; as it is shown by many reviews out there. However, Mozilla is working on a completely new Javascript engine, TraceMonkey, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://andreasgal.com/2008/09/03/tracemonkey-vs-v8/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;at first sight&lt;/a&gt; will put a hell of a fight with Chrome&amp;#8217;s V8. Who benefits from this? Us, users, of course. The more they fight, the better served we are 😉 .
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  To finish off my post, I just would like to clarify the reason I stick with Firefox. The point is that Firefox has been out there for quite a while now, and despite its security flaws here and there that have happened throghout time, it is pretty rock solid and secure. Google Chrome still has a lot to prove, it&amp;#8217;s still embrionary and it has a lot of growing up to do. Firefox also allows me to use addons that allow me to extend its features and I value this deeply, specially the possibility of using Foxmarks and of changing dictionaries quickly. These are practical things that I cannot go without, hence choosing Firefox for my day-to-day tasks. However, if what you do isn&amp;#8217;t exactly mission critical and if there aren&amp;#8217;t any extensions for Firefox that you use, then by all means, stick with Google Chrome. Only with a good userbase a piece of software can be improved.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Microsoft Dreamway 2008 &amp;#8211; Steve Ballmer</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Howdy my faithful readers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Today I am here to talk about Microsoft Dreamway. My goal is to outline what I have learned from it and how much of a great experience that it was.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  First off, I was the very first MSP to arrive there, so I checked myself in and waited around for more people to come. Finally more and more people started coming and another MSP came, Vânia. &amp;#8220;Okay&amp;#8230; what to do now? Let&amp;#8217;s get coffee.&amp;#8221; . After messing around with the map, we finally figured out where the &lt;em&gt;foyer&lt;/em&gt; was and where we were meant to eat cookies(!) and get our morning coffee.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After waiting for a while longer, more and more Student Partners started showing up and eventually the speeches started. The first one, with Pedro Rosa, was as usually quite good and before we knew it, we were having coffee again on the morning Coffee Break. Then off to speeches again, this time with Nuno Godinho; a speech on creating rich applications with Silverlight. Besides the fact that Nuno lost the notion of time on both of his speeches, they were quite helpful and inspiring. I had been wanting to try Silverlight for a while now and this was just the spark to get it going. Then came the speech about Visual Studio, which (I&amp;#8217;m sorry but) it was the less attractive one, even if I work with Visual Studio on almost a daily basis.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  And then it was time to lunch. They served some &amp;#8220;weird&amp;#8221; thing with codfish and &amp;#8230; stuff BUT, the desserts were delicious so all in all, despite having to stand during the whole thing, it wasn&amp;#8217;t so bad.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Stuffed up and cosy and the moment of the day arrived: Steve Ballmer&amp;#8217;s keynote speech. Massive crowd waiting at the doors of the main auditorium and when we were finally allowed in, it looked like they were offering free candy on the inside! Everyone wanted in, and lucky me, I got a place right on the second row 😀 (yeah, the original plan was to catch a drop of Steve&amp;#8217;s saliva and sell it on eBay afterwards , but that just didn&amp;#8217;t happen&amp;#8230; 🙁 bummer!). Turns out that the first speaker wasn&amp;#8217;t really Steve Ballmer but Miguel Caldas, who was also going to give a keynote speech but on Internet Explorer 8.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  *sigh*
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Don&amp;#8217;t take me wrong, Miguel was, to say the least, captivating, enthusiastic and funny: the perfect mixture in a speaker, so despite us all being fooled into thinking that we were going to be hearing from Steve first, it was quite good to hear all about IE8. As Miguel said: on IE8, Microsoft is finally caring about standards and about developers. We all know how much of a pain in the rear it is to develop something that looks the same in Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera and Safari (&amp;#8230;and some other browsers out there 😛 like Miguel said &amp;#8211; clearly talking about Chrome).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After a while into Miguel&amp;#8217;s speech, Steve arrives on the building and he&amp;#8217;s announced with a quite funky music. This was &lt;strong&gt;THE&lt;/strong&gt; moment of the day and I was enjoying it to the fullest! Steve delivered a fun and objective speech, and I found out how powerful his voice really is 😛 I bet he wouldn&amp;#8217;t really need a microphone nor speakers to get his voice to reach to the people back in the last rows. He does talk loud but also very clearly and without much of an accent.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So, about this speech, Steve basically pointed out where we are today and how things are developping at Microsoft, and how things are most likely to look in 10 years from now. He was also suspicious about someone being there to evaluate his IQ, as he kept tripping on one of the LCDs laid in front of him, on the ground 😛 so he said he &amp;#8220;suspected that someone was judging his ability to learn&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; you failed Steve. 😛
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So to cut this post short, afterwards we had the second part about Silverlight, then another coffee break and lastly, Pedro Rosa again, this time talking about Virtual Earth and how it can be used as a base to develop so many interesting and useful things. Definitely something to be looked upon. I still have to know more about the licensing because depending on that, I may be going to use it on a secret ASP .NET project of mine 😉 .
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  In a nutshell: the event was brilliantly organized (some chairs on the &lt;em&gt;foyer&lt;/em&gt; and on the lunch-tent wouldn&amp;#8217;t have hurted though&amp;#8230;), I got in for free thanks to being a Microsoft Student Partner so&amp;#8230; free education, free food and a free good time with friends&amp;#8230; hell yes! I&amp;#8217;m all for that! 😀
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Oh and Steve, thanks for your e-mail address. And yes, I know you have wanted it for a while now, and I&amp;#8217;ve decided to concede: you can come to my place whenever you like. Yes, really. 😉
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  P.S. Please bring a copy of Windows Cloud!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This Microsoft event is taking place on October 3rd, on Lisbon at the Centro Cultural de Belém, and guess what? That&amp;#8217;s right, I will be there 😀 thanks to being an MSP I get to attend the event without having to pay a dime. Neat huh? Can barely wait to see Monke&amp;#8230;. I mean, Steve Ballmer on stage with all his energy 😉 .
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Here&amp;#8217;s the schedule I picked:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;8h30 &amp;#8211; Welcome Coffee&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;9h15 &amp;#8211; Dev01 &amp;#8211; Software development: The current status and future trends of technological development&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;10h15 &amp;#8211; Coffee Break&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;10h45 &amp;#8211; Dev02 &amp;#8211; Creating rich applications using Silverlight 2.0 (2 sessions)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;12h45 &amp;#8211; Lunch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 14h40 &amp;#8211; Keynote&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Dreamway:&lt;/strong&gt; Microsoft today and tomorrow, &lt;em&gt;Steve Ballmer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;IE8:&lt;/strong&gt; pushing the web forward, &lt;em&gt;Miguel Caldas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 16h00 &amp;#8211; ITP04 &amp;#8211; SQL Server 2008 as an enterprise grade database platform &amp;#8211; How to manage and provide robust, reliable, scalable and innovative solutions&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;17h00 &amp;#8211; Coffee Break&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 17h30 &amp;#8211; Dev09 &amp;#8211; Windows Presentation Foundation: How can we take advantage of this technology to improve the user experience
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So, yeah, it&amp;#8217;s my first event of the kind and I&amp;#8217;m hoping it will be a great experience to learn 🙂 I&amp;#8217;ll keep you readers posted on how it goes.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MSP Team Building 2009</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/mspcard1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[118]&quot; title=&quot;mspcard1&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-120&quot; style=&quot;margin: 5px; float: right;&quot; title=&quot;mspcard1&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/mspcard1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;215&quot; height=&quot;286&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;First off, my apologies for having gone for so long without posting anything, but the truth is that I have been too busy to think about my blog. I have had my vacations on Lagos and right after that, I went to the far North of Portugal with the rest of the Portuguese Microsoft Student Partners.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  It was a great experience, an amazing chance to learn from people who have been in our shoes at some point and have thrived brilliantly, and also a fabulous opportunity to get to know the other MSPs and to make new friends. All of this was certainly achieved. I met some really great people, some really smart and brilliant guys and the scenery was absolutely amazing. I know some people prefer beaches and all sunny weather and that stuff, me I enjoy mountains, cool breezes and deep, green valleys 🙂 so the place was perfectly picked, except that it was oddly warm for this time of the year, but oh well&amp;#8230; you can&amp;#8217;t understand weather these days anymore.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The funniest/weirdest experience was definitely showering to the light of a flashlight. Right as we were getting ready to leave, a massive thunderstorm fell upon the place with lots of raining, and all I remember was hearing a big *KABOOM* and all of a sudden I was in a completely dark bathroom. One of my mates (Nuno Sousa) kindly borrowed me his flashlight and that&amp;#8217;s how I had to finish my shower.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  All in all and everything considered, it was a wonderful weekend and well worth the effort of spending 6 hours in a train 😛 .
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Solid State Musical Tesla Coil</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    Ok, so this isn&amp;#8217;t much in concordance with what I have posted before but hey, it is still technology at its peak and I loved the concept. For those who don&amp;#8217;t know, Tesla Coils get their name from their inventor, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla&quot;&gt;Nikola Tesla&lt;/a&gt;. The initial idea was to actually transport energy through wireless means, very much like Intel &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080821/ts_afp/usitinternetenergychipcompanyintel&quot;&gt;is attempting&lt;/a&gt; except that with Intel&amp;#8217;s plans apparently there&amp;#8217;s no human electrocution involved. I know, sad 🙁 .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    Anyhow, I&amp;#8217;m going to leave you to the point of this blog post which is the use of Tesla Coils pretty much as speakers. Some guys built the paraphernalia needed to convert musical waves into digital tones, so that they can afterwards be used as triggers to the coils. Typically we wouldn&amp;#8217;t hear such a coil ressonate, but the whole idea is that they turn the coil on and off enough times per second to insert the noise into a range that is actually audible by humans. You can learn more about it on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOkTrqTd0hw&amp;amp;feature=user&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; video, which explains it briefly. Don&amp;#8217;t bother if you&amp;#8217;re not a tech geek.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    Now, to the actual amazing videos, we have:
  &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYHPZgq_Kgo&amp;amp;feature=user&quot;&gt;Tetris Theme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX5V_9s0Gfw&amp;amp;feature=user&quot;&gt;Mario Bros Theme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LudXCEZvn50&amp;amp;feature=related&quot;&gt;Zelda Theme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEG-1iYpgKU&amp;amp;feature=related&quot;&gt;Ghostbusters Theme&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did, simply because it jaw-dropped me. If you did enjoy it, please feel free to drop me a comment, or better yet, &lt;a href=&quot;http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiagoespinha.net%2F2008%2F09%2Fsolid-state-musical-tesla-coil%2F&amp;amp;title=Solid%20State%20Musical%20Tesla%20Coil&quot;&gt;DIGG&lt;/a&gt; this article 😀 .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    As an end note, if you like this concept, I would also recommend watching the movie &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Prestige&lt;/a&gt; with the great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000288/&quot;&gt;Christian Bale&lt;/a&gt; (I&amp;#8217;m sorry, now I&amp;#8217;m just teasing the Batman fans&amp;#8230;) which happens to be one of my favourite movies of all time. Enjoy!
  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Google Chrome Released</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Here it is, the browser made by the guys at Google. First things first, and a thank you to Pedro Sousa is due for having brought this to my attention as I had no idea that Google was even working on their own browser.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  To be honest, I have been trying Google Chrome for a few minutes now and I was very impressed. It looked like and improved Firefox but now I&amp;#8217;ve just logged into my blog and the rust started to show. Basically, in the admin panel of wordpress, everything is out of place and a real mess. Who is to blame? I have no clue. But all of this worked on Firefox&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I think that the major advantage I have found so far is the fact that each tab runs on a different process, which is the way things should be. That way, when one page crashes, it isn&amp;#8217;t your whole browser that goes down but just that very page. In a time where web exploits are at their peak, this is very important. Also kudos to the fact that you can easily detach tabs from a window into a separate window, and then add tabs to that window that you just created. It really is THAT easy!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The major disadvantage, is the fact that you can&amp;#8217;t switch dictionaries quickly and conveniently from the context menu inside a &amp;#8220;textarea&amp;#8221; which you can do on Firefox. For someone who has to alternate between Portuguese and English dictionaries, this is a major turn-down. Specially because it seems that you even have to restart the browser for the changes to take effect. Bad, bad Google. What were you thinking?!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Other than this I have also loved the seamless integration with Windows Vista. Chrome just integrates much better on Vista&amp;#8217;s look than Firefox does. Firefox barely supports transparency, whereas Chrome allows for transparency, even on the zone where the tabs reside.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  In a nutshell, it&amp;#8217;s still a beta version, and that does show. Try it at your own peril, but try it nonetheless. I think you will be impressed.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My First MSP Experience</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Here I am again, this time writing about my first experience as a Microsoft Student Partner, or at least as an MSP-to-be 😛 .
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This wasn&amp;#8217;t exactly planned, instead it was Rodrigo&amp;#8217;s idea to invite me to come along. Rodrigo is the current MSP at ESTG Leiria and for the next year, I will be &amp;#8220;taking his place&amp;#8221;, hence the invitation with the purpose of getting me into the spirit of the thing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The plan was to visit a children nursing house in Leiria. Basically it&amp;#8217;s a house where children are sent to when they either have lost their parents or when their parents simply can&amp;#8217;t support them in a good environment. So we were to visit the said house and offer them a brand new XBOX with 2 games. We did so and everyone was happy, we were happy for having done the good deed of the day, the kids were happy because they had been given a new toy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  After some conversation regarding some basic courses we will also be providing the children with, we all came back home. Not much was settled regarding these courses, since the holidays are ending and the whole school fuss is starting to spin again, so there aren&amp;#8217;t many certainties regarding schedules yet, but this will be the plan for the upcoming months: arrange for the children to be taught basic notions on Windows and Word.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;ll keep the news coming as I have them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;m also posting a password-protected post with the pictures from this event, just to make sure that only allowed people get to see them, as I&amp;#8217;m not the only one in them. 🙂
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Birthday Gift</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This post comes more on the personal edge. Actually, it&amp;#8217;s more like me showing off something and being damn proud of it 😉 but hey, I am of the opinion that an image is worth for a thousand words, so here go two thousand words for you to read! On a little background note, this was my best friend&amp;#8217;s birthday gift 🙂 .
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  So with this said, thank you very much Katy and let&amp;#8217;s get on with the images, shall we? 😀

        <title>NASA found life out there!</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  No, not really. It is actually just an earthling virus that made it to outer space, and it isn&amp;#8217;t even a real living virus, it&amp;#8217;s a computer virus.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Disappointed? Don&amp;#8217;t be. It is still pretty cool how something like this can happen. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7583805.stm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt; the virus made it to the International Space Station through laptops used by astronauts. Luckily these laptops aren&amp;#8217;t mission-critical and apparently there is no permanent Internet link on the ISS, and all data exchanged with Earth is actually scanned first. Disappointed even further? Seriously, don&amp;#8217;t be. Someone was dumb enough to get their USB pen drives infected with viruses and further on to use them on orbit, without having checked it for virus or anything.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Looks like NASA should include a few basic computer security classes on their astronaut training&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stargate Atlantis comes to an end&amp;#8230;</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Those of you who know me well, know that I am an avid fan of everything that is Stargate related. Yes, I watched the whole 10 seasons of Stargate SG-1 and I have followed every single episode of Stargate Atlantis so far. It is simply a show I cannot get enough of.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Still, the tv network SciFi seems to be determined in upsetting me and all the Stargate fans out there. First they pulled the plug on SG-1 and now, they &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tv.com/story/11569.html?tag=topslot;link;1&amp;amp;om_act=convert&amp;amp;om_clk=topslot&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;decide to do the same&lt;/a&gt; on Atlantis&amp;#8217; , as soon as its fifth season ends. What are the true space fans supposed to watch now?! Battlestar Galactica? I&amp;#8217;m sorry, but I&amp;#8217;m a little over sneaky women in red dresses, and the whole worthless drama surrounding that tv series which was so promising to start with.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Well, not all hope is lost though&amp;#8230; Apparently a new Stargate series is on the making, this one of its name Stargate Universe. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tv.com/story/11571.html?tag=topslot;link;0&amp;amp;om_act=convert&amp;amp;om_clk=topslot&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tv.com&lt;/a&gt; this new series will be about a «a group of explorers board an abandoned, Ancients-built starship called The Destiny» *raise eyebrow*. I was a little bit excited at the prospect of a new Stargate series since I had known about it for a while, but what I did not expect was the sudden decision of shutting down Atlantis &amp;#8211; now, with this information regarding Universe, my skepticism is through the roof. A Stargate series without travelling through Stargates? Err&amp;#8230; is it me or something does not match?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Unless of course, The Destiny is small enough to fit into the Stargate, but then it is most likely a puddle-jumper, and that would be utterly boring. Maybe I&amp;#8217;m being too harsh but I think that SciFi is inevitably killing the original spirit of the Stargate. Give us something new, but not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; new&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  On the streak of &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;&quot;&gt;good news&lt;/span&gt; reasonable news is the fact that the Stargate fans will also have the MMORPG game coming out relatively soon. Once again however, the game isn&amp;#8217;t overly based on the tv show and whilst I am excited to try it out, I&amp;#8217;m also taking it with a grain of salt.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  According to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/stargateworlds/news.html?sid=6184182&amp;amp;mode=previews&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; carried out by GameSpot, it seems that Stargate Worlds will actually be some sort of World of Stargate.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This means we can&amp;#8217;t keep retelling the story of &lt;em&gt;SG-1&lt;/em&gt;. We&amp;#8217;re going to let players choose from seven archetypes&amp;#8211;Jaffa, Goa&amp;#8217;uld, Asgard, and human soldier, scientist, archeologist, and commando&amp;#8211;when they create a character.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Ah well, thank you SciFi for killing my inner-child 🙁
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chococlock</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-58&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #000000; margin: 2px; float: left;&quot; title=&quot;p1818h&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/p1818h.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;120&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; /&gt;Well, okay this is a very weird and useless gadget but if your girlfriend is suffering from anorexia and you have no clue what to give her on her birthday, here&amp;#8217;s the ideal gift!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So what is it actually? It&amp;#8217;s basically a &amp;#8220;cuckoo-clock&amp;#8221; that will release a chocolate every hour. Truth to be told, it is kind of dodgy that there is only a pink version of it. However, it is also the kind of gadget that simply does not work for people like me, since it actually has a button that allows you to cheat.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I wonder if there would be any chocolate left to dispense as soon as the hour mark came&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  You can buy it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firebox.com/product/1818/Chococlock?aff=512&amp;amp;awc=550_1219389967_a238d2bcebc8b36359f1d98aa4e09e17&amp;amp;currency_conversion=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the friendly price of $37 USD.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Microsoft Student Partner &amp;#8211; The Outcome</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Well, I could not have better news today: I was accepted into Microsoft&amp;#8217;s Student Partner Program! Out of the initial 30 students who had been called for an interview in Lisbon, 20 of us got picked and I am amongst those 20.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  The thrill starts right away in September, month on which we were asked to not make any plans for either the first nor the last weekend. I&amp;#8217;m still a little bit on the dark, regarding what&amp;#8217;s happening and where but we were promised more news soon, so I can but to wait to hear more from the people in charge. I&amp;#8217;ll post here when I know more.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AMD acts, Intel reacts: Atom Dual-Core</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So on my last blog post I mentioned how AMD isn&amp;#8217;t sleeping, and how it had released a low-power version of their Athlon64 CPU, the 2000+ to go head-to-head with Intel&amp;#8217;s Atom processor. Well as it turns out, Intel certainly hadn&amp;#8217;t given its last word on the subject.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Perhaps in the light of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/2008/08/amd-is-dead-think-again/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;AMD&amp;#8217;s move&lt;/a&gt; on the low-end market, Intel decided that the release of the dual-core version of the Atom processor, the Atom 330, will occur sooner than expected.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Our sources tell us that this chip will run at the frequency of 1.6Ghz and it will have a total L2 cache of 1Mb (512Kb per core) and it will run on the same 533Mhz bus as its single-core counterpart (N270). It is expected that the Atom 330 will be significantly faster than the Atom 230 which was trampled by Via&amp;#8217;s Nano according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/reviews/hardware/atom-nano-review.ars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; by Ars Technica.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  It is also worth mentioning that both cores on Atom 330 will have the HyperThreading technology and as a result, the operating system will have 4 virtual cores at its disposal. It needs to be noted that this HT technology was dropped in the Core platform and it&amp;#8217;s now being brought back to life on both the Atom and &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.zdnet.co.uk/hardware/0,1000000091,39286539,00.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nehalem architectures&lt;/a&gt;. Rumour went that this technology was dropped because it was ineffective and in some cases it would even draw more power than a dual-CPU solution, so we can only hope that Intel knows what they are doing.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AMD is dead? Think again&amp;#8230;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-46 alignright&quot; style=&quot;margin: 5px; float: right;&quot; title=&quot;AMD Athlon 64 Logo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/amdcpu232.gif&quot; alt=&quot;AMD Athlon 64 Logo&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/amdcpu232.gif 300w, https://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/amdcpu232-150x150.gif 150w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  So you thought AMD was dead? Well that is not what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/Atom-Athlon-Efficient,1997.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; review by Tom&amp;#8217;s Hardware shows us. It is true that the Core 2 platform has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=12061&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;smashed&lt;/a&gt; the competition from AMD on pretty much every front of the market, but this tide might be about to turn.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  With the recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crn.com.au/News/81629,netbook-sales-to-soar-in-2008.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;outbreak of netbook computers&lt;/a&gt; like the Asus Eee PC, it leaves us to wonder where the big bucks might be coming from in the near future. Perhaps with this in mind, AMD downclocked and undervolted its Athlon64 segment to start headbutting with Intel&amp;#8217;s Atom architecture. Truth to be told, they apparently succeeded on creating a platform that outperforms Atom on efficiency, where as by efficiency we understand processing capacity over power consumed. Actually, the Athlon64 2000+ runs at lower a frequency than Intel&amp;#8217;s counterpart, but as we have seen in the past, when it comes to getting the most out of the same frequency, AMD is on top due to their more efficient architecture. This said, not only the A64 runs at a lower frequency, but it also does outperform Intel&amp;#8217;s Atom CPU.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Personally, on a time where the dillema is what Intel CPU to choose rather than to choose between Intel and AMD, and being on a stalemate because of it, I think this is nothing but good news. Not only for AMD themselves but for the market in general, because we all know what happens when companies monopolize markets, right?
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>iPosture: the ultimate solution for your back</title>
        <description>&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; margin: 5px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://tiagoespinha.info/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/iposture.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[38]&quot; title=&quot;iposture&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-39&quot; title=&quot;iposture&quot; src=&quot;http://tiagoespinha.info/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/iposture-300x216.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iPosture in action&quot; width=&quot;210&quot; height=&quot;151&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/iposture-300x216.jpg 300w, https://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/iposture.jpg 494w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  This discreet little gadget promises to straighten up your back from that weird slouching position that we all unconsciously acquire at some point. Be it because you spend too much time sitting or because you are a more direct relative to the apes, you will notice that your back is slightly curved at times. This is usually accompanied by your shoulders dropping down and pointing forward.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Here is what iPosture does to prevent this: as soon as you deviate from the ideal standing angle by just three degrees, it will vibrate until you correct your position or well&amp;#8230; until it gets its own pair of wings and flies straight towards the wall, even if this means of turning it off is heavily unadvised considering its prohibitive price of $99.95 (USD).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iposture.com/ip_howitworks.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; more on the device.

        <title>Pay to click: is it really worth it?</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Today I will be reviewing what seems to be the XXI century plague: the pay to click systems. The basic notion is that you are paid to watch a set of advertisement links for a certain period of time. After you do so, you get a credit of a few dollar cents in your account and additionally, when you reach a certain minimum amount of balance in your account you can ask for a checkout.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;!--more--&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    Now, when I said a few dollar cents, it really is a few dollar cents, as in usually you get paid $0.01 for each page-view which is a pretty meagre amount. Add this to the fact that at best, you get 10 to 20 ad-links to click upon (this varies between PTC systems) and it does not take a genius to do the math and know that you will not be making that much profit out of this system.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    So why is it so widespread and why do people adhere to these systems so massively?
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    Mostly because there is more to it. All of the pay to click systems have a referal system. Actually, this is what keeps them in business.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    Referrals work in the following way: for each referral I have, I will also earn a certain amount of money for each click they make. On some PTCs this amount is actually the same as the amount I get for my own clicks, but on some systems this amount is downsized.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    Typically it will be hard to find a decent amount of referrals. It will be hard to find an amount big enough to actually render you more than just one or two dozens of dollars, but once again, most or all the PTC systems have a system to fight this: a referral market. Basically, you just buy referrals for money, and then it will be like if those referrals had in fact registered on that PTC site with your name as their referral. Do you see where this is getting now?
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    Let us consider the following scenario: you are consistently getting 5 ad-links per day, each will give you $0.01, so you on your own make $0.05 per day. Now, you had some spare money and bought 1000 referrals. Each of those referrals will also have the 5 links and they will also click on them; as a result, for each click, it will be as if you had clicked as well, so on the first day here&amp;#8217;s how much you will make:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    5 * 0.01 * 1000 = $50
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    Sounds better than a simple $0.05 per day, does it not? With an income like that, you can expect something in the order of $1500 per month, give or take.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    Maybe at this point some people who did not know about pay to click systems are jumping up and down, wanting to take the plunge and jump right into &lt;em&gt;the scene&lt;/em&gt;, but I am sure that many other readers will be skeptical. I know that the first question that came to my mind when I was introduced to this system was: where does the money come from?
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    Easy. It comes from advertisers who pay a fee to the PTC systems, so that they will publish their advertisements as part of the ad-links. Usually the advertisers pay an amount per page-views (i.e. per amount of times their link was clicked) which is just slightly higher than the amount of money that we, clickers, get for clicking &amp;#8211; allowing for huge profit for PTC owners.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    So now that you know their source of income, are you still skeptic? If you are, you are rightfully so. The essential fail on these systems is how saturated the web is with them; so much that the advertisers are in fact&amp;#8230;. &lt;strong&gt;other PTC companies!&lt;/strong&gt; No matter how much you look around, you will always find that PTC Site A has ad-links for PTC sites B, C and D &amp;#8211; and the site B has links for A, C and D and so on&amp;#8230; So in reality, this is actually a mangle of websites linking to one another, using profits of theirs to feed the profits of their &amp;#8220;opponents&amp;#8221; and we get to a point where we are recycling money between companies, in a very closed system, where the only fresh money that gets in, &lt;strong&gt;is actually money put in by &lt;em&gt;clickers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    Why don&amp;#8217;t real, honest, business companies want to advertise in PTC websites? Simple: whoever is in the PTC deal as a clicker, simply isn&amp;#8217;t in it for watching the ads. People will click the ad, keep browsing until the timer runs down, then close that tab, click the next ad and continue the process. This simply does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; serve the purpose of advertising. Companies advertise their products in the hopes of increasing their sales, because people will look at their ads and feel the urge to buy their products or to subscribe their services. This simply does not happen when people are in it for the money!
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    It is somewhat transitive: people click the ads but do not buy. Since people do not buy, the companies do not get the expected income. Let us face it, when a company invests X money in advertising, they are expecting an income of X+Y where they get back the amount they spent, plus a profit. If this profit does not appear, the companies will be less inclined towards advertising and they stop publishing their ads and it all crumbles like a building being demolished.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    This is the crux of the PTC systems having failed over and over and over. They are doomed to fail because the notion is flawed to begin with. The punch-line is: why being advertised at for free, whilst you can be get paid to watch advertisements?
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    Well, this is all really pretty, but you will never be looking at ads from real companies like Microsoft, Yahoo, Google or even of popular online games like World of Warcraft or EvE Online. Instead, you will be looking at ads from companies who also make a living out of PTC deals.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    So yeah, I am indeed registered on a few PTC sites and I do click regularly on all of them, but at this point, they are all self-managed. I get profit from PTC, I use it to buy referrals and hopefully at some point I will be leeching the money of people who have invested and given up. Truth is that to make big bucks in this sort of business, you must have big bucks to start with, and they must be disposable. It must be something like venture capital; money that you can simply lose, because there is a high risk involved. There is a risk of it not paying out as well as you expected, or simply the risk of the PTC company going bankrupt and then you have nothing. It has happened the past, many many companies in this field have gone belly-up and then, all those who had invested the big bucks are all of a sudden wiped out.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    Obviously, if the company lives long enough for you to make enough profit, so that it gets to be auto-recyclable, then it might be a good deal, but still with a very risky launching pad.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    So, in sum, it really isn&amp;#8217;t worth it unless you invest at least some money and if you do invest, do be ready to lose the money. You might hit jackpot in the long run, but the most likely ending is that you get no profit and you say goodbye to your money. Truth is: it is not something you can live from. If you had the starting money so that it could become good enough to live from it, then you are probably rich enough to not need this sort of programs to make a living and you will stay out of it.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    This is the core of pay to click websites, although there are some new services out there coming up with new innovative strategies that at a first glance, they all look like perfect ways to get more money. Still, none change the fact that these systems are all like a closed environment. Very little money gets in and tons of money seem to be getting out, not to mention the profit that the companies involved make.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    To finalize, if you want to make really good money, start your own pay to click service and when you have a few thousand bucks in balance, run away with it and never show up again 😛 otherwise, you might join the few poor ones and help out a bloke by trying out the service. These two services seem to be the most credible and faster payers out there. Be careful though, do not join every PTC service out there. Services like bux.to are simply a no-go due to it taking months from the time you ask for your money until you actually get it.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
    So if you want to give it a try, just click on these banners and get started. It is not much hard. 🙂

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  And hello again!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I&amp;#8217;m here fresh out of Lisbon and out of my MSP interview. I confess I was a little scared to start with but it is also true that all of the interviewers were very friendly and not scary at all. After being introduced to the whole content of the MSP program, the first question came: &amp;#8220;How many tracks does the Olympics swimming pool have?&amp;#8221;. Fortunately they were kidding when I was told I could not be an MSP since I answered that question incorrectly (I answered 6 and apparently it has 10 tracks) :P.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Other than this I&amp;#8217;d say I left a good impression, except the fact that I was nervous, no doubt about that &amp;#8211; but I am guessing (and hoping) that that is the case with most MSP interviewees. I like the spirit and the environment and whilst I do not know anything for certain yet, I think I am on the right track for success &amp;#8211; more news will follow and I promise I will keep you all posted!
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    P.S. Don&amp;#8217;t mind the ugly face on the picture 😛 there was heavy wind blowing on there.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Hello my dear friends and readers in general,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I come here today with a subject of great happiness and ecstasy! I was called in by Microsoft to be «interviewed» for Microsoft&amp;#8217;s Student Partner Program in Lisbon 😀 . So on August 13th there I shall go and attempt my best at getting the position. For the first time I will be even entering Microsoft&amp;#8217;s building so that alone is already stomach-tickling. It&amp;#8217;s set to be a great experience and I can but hope that I get a position as a MSP.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    As my best-friend would say: the plot thickens. 😉
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I shall keep news coming on this blog so stay tuned!
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    I reckon it has been a while since I have last posted on this blog but truth is that times have been busy. As some of the readers know, my birthday was on the August 4th, hence the time away from the blog.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I am also however working on TeddyBearNotes v2 which is still on an early stage. It will also come on two different flavours: your old freeware notes program and a corporate version, with more features and added functionality. So stay tuned!
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    In the meanwhile, I leave you with a lovely t-shirt I got as a birthday gift this year (thank you Kamilla!).
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Isn&amp;#8217;t it absolutely great? I was thinking, maybe we should plan a trip to Mt. Cheyenne&amp;#8230; I cannot wait to meet the Asgard 😉
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;#8216;Till the next time! *hums the Stargate tune*
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>TeddyBearNotes v1.2.0-0</title>
        <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://downloads.sourceforge.net/teddybearnotes/TeddyBearNotes-1.2.0-0_setup.zip?use_mirror=osdn&quot;&gt;Installer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://downloads.sourceforge.net/teddybearnotes/TeddyBearNotes_src_1.2.0-0.7z?use_mirror=osdn&quot;&gt;Source Code&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    New version release. This version includes both bug-fixes and improvements, refer to the change-log for a detailed overview of such changes.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Change-Log:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8211; Bug-Fix: If you had TeddyBearNotes keeping your window always open, when you shut-down your computer or simply close TBNotes, the notes would not be saved. They are now.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8211; Behaviour change: If you had TBNotes auto-hiding the window when it would lose focus, whenever you would click on the icon to get the window to open again your text cursor would be &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;behind&lt;/span&gt; the text already on the note window, whereas now, the cursor shows up on front of all the text present in the box, allowing you to start typing right away.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Got any suggestions for TeddyBear Notes? Please e-mail them to me at tiago[at]espinhas[dot]net or post comments here, on my blog!

        <title>How TeddyBear Notes will change your life</title>
        <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  At some point, we have all used post-its. Some people admittedly use it &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/cms/bcc/blogpics/postit.jpg&quot;&gt;more than others&lt;/a&gt; but we have all used them. They are very handy and at really busy times, we humans have a knack for forgetting things, thus there is the need to note down stuff.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    However, post-its use up space, either stuck to your monitor screen or messed up around your desk, and let us face it: nowadays, if you have a desk, it is very likely that you have a PC. If you do, you came to the right place.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    The question I am going to ask you is: if you wanted to write a note for yourself right now on a post-it, what would you have to do? You would probably have to search for your post-it stash, then find a pen that actually still does its job (and we all know how hard that is&amp;#8230;) and only then write your notes down, only to be limited by a really small writing area.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    What if I told you that you could have a (friendly-looking) icon in your system tray (that zone next to the clock on your Windows start bar), where you just have to click it to have a fully customizable text box show up? Even better, what if that text box instantly vanishes as soon as you resume the work you were doing on your computer, safely encrypting the notes in your hard drive with a world renowned algorithm, effectively keeping your notes secure?
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    It sounds good so far? Well keep reading!
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Imagine this scenario: your office or your home gets broken into. Tough luck. You had post-its all over your computer monitor, with your passwords for your online banking, for your instant messaging services, for your e-mail, for your online DMV access, and now it&amp;#8217;s all gone. The thieves stole your computer altogether and it is all in their hands now. You have to go through all the hassle of changing all your passwords.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    What if you were using TeddyBear Notes? Not by a slim chance would they have access to your stuff! Not only can you store a limit-less amount of information in it but you can choose to encrypt the notes! Do you know which encryption algorithm TeddyBear Notes uses? You do not need to be a genius to know this: it uses the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard&quot;&gt;AES algorithm&lt;/a&gt;, also widely known as the Rijndael algorithm. Heck, that is the algorithm used by the US government! We all know how the North-Americans value their security so whilst I do not know the inner workings of the algorithm (I am not a mathmatician), I certainly trust what is one of the most secure algorithms out there.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    You cannot go wrong with this little application. TeddyBear Notes is lightweight, it has a really really small footprint on your computer&amp;#8217;s memory and you can customize it. No longer will you have to stick with boring yellow post-its. Are you a girly girl with a passion for pink? Great! Change the background colour for pink and customize the font type and colour for whichever you like.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Do you know what is the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;pièce de résistance&lt;/span&gt; about TeddyBear Notes? It is and and &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;absolutely free&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;open-source&lt;/span&gt;! Just like Linux, to name an example. Now, when was the last time you heard of someone using Linux and getting hacked or catching viruses? You probably have never heard about it. The big advantage of using open-source software is that it is not just my eyes (the developer&amp;#8217;s) that are ensuring that this application is safe, instead, it is the eyes of hundreds of programmers all around the world! Simply because the code is available for everyone to download and have a look. Doesn&amp;#8217;t this make TeddyBear Notes unsafe, you ask? Not in the slightest. The safest algorithms and programs in the world are all open-source (including AES) and the reason for that is what I just mentioned: they are being proofed by thousands of people all around the world. Besides, your notes are encrypted with an algorithm through the means of a &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;. Without that password, tough luck for hackers. It would take decades worth of really massive computing to crack your notes specifically, and another whole lot of decades to crack anyone else&amp;#8217;s.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Do you like what you see? Wonderful. This post is my introduction post to TeddyBear Notes, so essentially all you have to do is go to &lt;a href=&quot;www.tiagoespinha.net&quot;&gt;www.tiagoespinha.net&lt;/a&gt; and then click the tag &amp;#8220;teddybearnotes&amp;#8221; on the right-hand menu. Now you only have to search for the post with the latest version (1.1.1-5 at the time of the posting), download it and install the program.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Lastly, if you want to donate, please feel free to. Donations are &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;voluntary&lt;/span&gt; and TeddyBear Notes will always be &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;free&lt;/span&gt;. However, if you like the program and are feeling generous, you can donate any amount you like to my PayPal account through the link on the right or by clicking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&amp;amp;business=tiago%40espinhas%2enet&amp;amp;item_name=TiagoEspinha%2enet&amp;amp;no_shipping=0&amp;amp;no_note=1&amp;amp;tax=0&amp;amp;currency_code=EUR&amp;amp;lc=PT&amp;amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;amp;charset=UTF%2d8&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

        <title>TeddyBearNotes v1.1.1-5</title>
        <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://downloads.sourceforge.net/teddybearnotes/TeddyBearNotes-1.1.1-5_setup.zip?use_mirror=osdn&quot;&gt;Installer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://downloads.sourceforge.net/teddybearnotes/TeddyBearNotes_src_1.1.1-5.7z?use_mirror=osdn&quot;&gt;Source Code&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    This version is just a hotfix for a bug (this time on Vista) that was introduced with the last version. The bug would make TeddyBear Notes crash on Startup, should that option be enabled. Updatting is recommended.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Change Log:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8211; Bug fix: The «Startup Path» for the shortcut that is put in place for automatic startup was including the filename in the path, which would lead to Windows Vista (it was not tested on XP but it is likely that the problem is also replicable there) to close TeddyBear Notes.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>TeddyBearNotes v1.1.1-0</title>
        <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://downloads.sourceforge.net/teddybearnotes/TeddyBearNotes-1.1.1-0_setup.zip?use_mirror=osdn&quot;&gt;Installer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://downloads.sourceforge.net/teddybearnotes/TeddyBearNotes_src_1.1.1.0.7z?use_mirror=osdn&quot;&gt;Source Code&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    That&amp;#8217;s right! Such a young application and there&amp;#8217;s already an update for it. This is actually a somewhat critical update if you have been experiencing issues with vanishing notes. If you had such issues, worry not, your notes are totally safe &amp;#8211; if you had not had any issue at all, you are still advised to upgrade as soon as possible.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    This version has two changes:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8211; The XML and the XSD files now have a version of its own, this meaning that I can keep releasing versions that do not directly interfere with the structure of the said files, without having to worry about providing means of backup and restore across installs of such versions.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    As a more technical background on this change, the XML and XSD file names now have a version based on the executable version, whereas the actual application version is given by the assembly version. So basically, if you right click your executable and click «Properties», the version you will see there is actually the version of the files it is using as storage.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;#8211; The second change is a &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;bug fix&lt;/span&gt;. The option of getting the program to startup with Windows had a flaw under Windows XP (this does NOT affect Windows Vista &amp;#8211; read below why). TeddyBear Notes would create a shortcut under Windows&amp;#8217; startup folder but it was setting a wrong «Startup Path», resulting in the following effect:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    -&amp;gt; If you started storing notes when the program was launched on Startup, and then for some reason you closed the program and opened it again manually, you would have an empty note window.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    -&amp;gt; The same would happen if you were to start using the program by launching it manually and then tried to access your notes when it had been started up automatically.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Q: Why does this not affect Windows Vista?&lt;br /&gt;A: Due to slackness of myself (and partly due to convenience), I am storing the data files on the installation directory. Microsoft does &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; condone this practice on Windows Vista and it has measures in place where it will simply automatically redirect the files elsewhere, as it will also redirect the shortcut startup path.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    [This note does not apply if you are making a clean install of TeddyBear Notes]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;NOTE: &lt;/span&gt;If after installing this version you can no longer see your notes, do not panic! Just follow these simple steps:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;1. Click Start then go over to &amp;#8220;Startup&amp;#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;2. You should have a file named &amp;#8220;TBN_1_1_0_4.xml&amp;#8221; in there&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;3. Right-click the file and choose &amp;#8220;Cut&amp;#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;4. Go to the path where you have installed TeddyBear Notes (by default C:\Program Files\TeddyBearNotes)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;5. Right-click inside that folder and &amp;#8220;Paste&amp;#8221; the file in it.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;On step 2, if there is no file under &amp;#8220;Startup&amp;#8221;, please contact me through my e-mail: tiago[at]espinhas[dot]net .&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;A thank you is due to my friend and TeddyBear Notes user (and beta tester), Esther van Ginneken.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

        <title>Google Code Jam part 2</title>
        <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Here I am again talking about Google Code Jam, unfortunately not with good news. 🙁&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    That is right, I managed to successfully solve a small data set for one of Code Jam&amp;#8217;s problems but not only did I take a very long time to do so, the large data set was also wrong. This said, at the end I did not have the enough points to get through to the next round and I am out.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    In a way I am glad that I did not pass&amp;#8230; I was getting an headache after each round, and that&amp;#8217;s something I can do without.
  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TODO List</title>
        <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Dear TeddyBearNotes users,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    This post will be my ongoing list of things I want done in future versions of TeddyBearNotes. So for 1.2.0-0 here&amp;#8217;s the TODO:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;#8211; Position the cursor at the end of the text when the Notes window is opened.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    If you have any suggestions for bettering this application, please by all means, send me e-mails, post comments, your choice!&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>(TeddyBearNotes) Note for the readers&amp;#8230;</title>
        <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Apparently, TeddyBearNotes is about to get famous, thanks to my ever so loved friend Katy Thomas.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    The note I want to leave is that on the current version of this application (1.1.0-4), the users are linked to http://www.tiagoespinha.net on the About page. Well, just so that people will not end there by mistake, that page is still being worked upon so for now, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tiagoprod.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is the home of TeddyBearNotes.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    See you soon!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Google Code Jam part 1</title>
        <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  It is with much sorrow that I write this post because unfortunately, I did not pass on the first round of Google Code Jam 🙁 a real shame. The opinion is shared though: many other people were complaining about how cryptic the problem descriptions were and that was so. The genius heads at Google are more likely probing our mind reading capabilities, rather than our skill at &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;programming algorithms&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Am I the only one to disagree that on a competition called &amp;#8220;Google &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Code Jam&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; we are to be tested on our mathematical skills? I mean, for God&amp;#8217;s sake, programming is not (just) about maths! There is so much more to it. One thing I can tell you all: I am going to try my luck tomorrow, but certainly not going to apply for the 2009 version of the competition.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I am done with the headaches for no end-game at all. And now&amp;#8230;. Stargate Atlantis time, the true joy of life 😉
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>.NET Framework 3.5</title>
        <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  A friend of mine pointed out that TBNotes&amp;#8217; installer will report that the .NET Framework 3.5 is not installed, but a place to where download it from is not provided with it. Therefore, I decided to make a post with the links for downloading the framework:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;#8211; If you have Internet access where you want to install the framework, then download &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/info.aspx?na=90&amp;amp;p=&amp;amp;SrcDisplayLang=en&amp;amp;SrcCategoryId=&amp;amp;SrcFamilyId=333325fd-ae52-4e35-b531-508d977d32a6&amp;amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fdownload.microsoft.com%2fdownload%2f7%2f0%2f3%2f703455ee-a747-4cc8-bd3e-98a615c3aedb%2fdotNetFx35setup.exe&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;#8211; As an alternative, you can download the full thing &lt;a href=&quot;http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/0/f/60fc5854-3cb8-4892-b6db-bd4f42510f28/dotnetfx35.exe&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; which is a bigger download and it installs the .NET Framework 3.5 without requiring Internet access at the target computer.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Keep in mind: if you do have Internet access, the &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;first option&lt;/span&gt; is the indicated for your needs as it will only download the necessary files.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>TeddyBearNotes v1.1.0-4</title>
        <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;EDIT:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt; The links were broken. Apparently the RAR was corrupt, but now it should all be well.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I am back!
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Well, this time I&amp;#8217;m here to publicize my first masterpiece, the &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;TeddyBearNotes&lt;/span&gt;!
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    For those of you who already knew &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nullsoft.com/free/safesex/&quot;&gt;SafeSex&lt;/a&gt;, TeddyBearNotes is a more pleasant version of this tool, developed upon more recent technologies. Truth to be told, it also is not very pleasant to be labeled as a pervert for constantly having a hovering window on our screen, reading &amp;#8220;SafeSex&amp;#8221;. It is Safe&amp;#8230; but it is a bit inconvenient for those who have no knowledge of what the program is about.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Because of all this, and at the request of a friend of mine, I decided to develop this very friendly application, both in its name as well as on its ease of use, and its graphical environment.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    For those who did not know SafeSex, this application allows us to store text notes for later access; an improved notepad of sorts. SafeSex leaves us a small rectangle on our desktop and you just have to click it in order to get to your notes.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Let us now go onto the technical details. TeddyBearNotes was developed upon the .NET Framework 3.5, using C# as the language. The notes are stored in the hard drive in an XML file and they can be optionally encrypted. The encryption resorts to a widely known algorithm, the AES (also known as the Rijndael algorithm) which is also the algorithm used by the North-American government.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    TeddyBearNotes also allows you to have it boot up automatically with Windows and it also gives you the possibility of completely customizing the window where you write your notes.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    As far as licensing goes, this program is open-source and distributed under the BSD license (read the file inside the source code package). It is therefore possible to redistribute the code as long as the original license file is kept, with the due credits to myself.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I think I have not missed anything so I will leave here the temporary download links. As soon as the project gets approved on SourceForge I shall change the links to the final ones.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://downloads.sourceforge.net/teddybearnotes/TeddyBearNotes-1.1.0-4_setup.zip?use_mirror=osdn&quot;&gt;Installer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://downloads.sourceforge.net/teddybearnotes/TeddyBearNotes_src_1.1.0-4.7z?use_mirror=osdn&quot;&gt;Source Code&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>First Post</title>
        <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Well, here goes my first post.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    At the moment, this is the blog where I will publish my ideas, applications that I develop and news of my world. I have a website of my own on the making but that will still take a while until it is fully operational. Until then, a simple blog will have to do.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Stay tuned because in a little while I will be publishing my first application for the masses: the TeddyBearNotes.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
