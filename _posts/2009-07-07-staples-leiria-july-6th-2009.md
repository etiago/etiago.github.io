  Below is a shot taken in Leiria, Portugal at the doors of the chain retailer Staples. The crowd patiently awaits for the doors to open for a stock-off sale. Later on people ended up losing their patience and forced the entry; the police was called to the spot to help with the crowd control.

  There are reports of people literally camping the store, having parked there at 22h of the previous day and slept there during the night. Amazing.
