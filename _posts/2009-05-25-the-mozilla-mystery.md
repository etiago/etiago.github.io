Howdy readers,

Today I bring you one of the long time mysteries for me. Why in heavens does Mozilla insist on making different menus for Firefox and Thunderbird depending on whether you&#8217;re using it on Linux or Windows? Seriously, I just can&#8217;t figure out the reason for this&#8230; the Options menu sits in the Tools toolbar in Windows, whereas in the Linux version, it goes under Edit. But WHY?!

&#8216;Till the next time!
