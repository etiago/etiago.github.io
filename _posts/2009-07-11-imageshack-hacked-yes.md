  The famous website for hosting images, imageshack.us, has just recently been hacked with the manifesto below. Our <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/07/10/imageshack-hacked/" target="_blank">sources</a> say all images were replaced with this manifesto, but according to the manifesto itself «no images were harmed in the making of this&#8230; image». Let&#8217;s hope for the users&#8217; sake that this is indeed true.

  It remains to be seen what does Imageshack actually have to do with the topic of this manifesto&#8230;
