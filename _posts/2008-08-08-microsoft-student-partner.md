<div style="text-align: justify;">
  Hello my dear friends and readers in general,</p> 
  
  <p>
    I come here today with a subject of great happiness and ecstasy! I was called in by Microsoft to be Â«interviewedÂ» for Microsoft&#8217;s Student Partner Program in Lisbon ðŸ˜€ . So on August 13th there I shall go and attempt my best at getting the position. For the first time I will be even entering Microsoft&#8217;s building so that alone is already stomach-tickling. It&#8217;s set to be a great experience and I can but hope that I get a position as a MSP.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As my best-friend would say: the plot thickens. ðŸ˜‰
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I shall keep news coming on this blog so stay tuned!
  </p>
