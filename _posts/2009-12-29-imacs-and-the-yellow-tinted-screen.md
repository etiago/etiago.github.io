  Oh oh! No, not Santa, this is actually a juicy story. Mark Wilson at <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5436442/apple-has-thwarted-my-efforts-so-i-need-your-help?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+gizmodo/full+(Gizmodo)&utm_content=Google+Reader" target="_blank">Gizmodo</a> brings us an issue with the latest Apple&#8217;s iMacs. According to said person, some of the latest iMacs randomly display a yellow tinted screen, turning the whites into&#8230; well&#8230; yellow. Manufacturing issues like this happen you say, and I would agree; that&#8217;s not really the issue in this case.

  The issue is the fact that Mark&#8217;s iMac was exchanged but the replacement computer is also icteric. So what&#8217;s the deal? Well, I&#8217;m not a fan boy for either side, I&#8217;m not fanatic so this brings me no special joy; despite that, I share Mark&#8217;s opinion on the issue: multi-thousand dollar computers, computers that are known for being overpriced for their specifications, shouldn&#8217;t have issues like this. Moreso, the issue should never happen again on a replacement computer. This can only mean one of two things &#8211; either the issue is happening on a large percentage of iMacs or Mark has just been extremely unlucky. Considering Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2235367&start=0&tstart=0" target="_blank">previous</a> <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=824940" target="_blank">rapport</a> with <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2212682&tstart=0" target="_blank">manufacturing</a> <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2238709&tstart=0" target="_blank">issues</a> and faulty parts, I would go with the former.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Right now Apple has been creepy and resorted to shady backstage data mining to flag Mark&#8217;s Apple account to disallow any other exchanges; apparently his computer will now be repaired instead. Mark isn&#8217;t happy and he&#8217;s trying to spread the word; this is my attempt to help him and to get Apple to change this behavior. This would be acceptable from a cheap computer brand but not from Apple, THE most expensive computer brand, whose flagship is to produce computers with above-par quality. This sure as hell isn&#8217;t above-par.
