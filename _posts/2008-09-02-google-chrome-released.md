  Here it is, the browser made by the guys at Google. First things first, and a thank you to Pedro Sousa is due for having brought this to my attention as I had no idea that Google was even working on their own browser.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  To be honest, I have been trying Google Chrome for a few minutes now and I was very impressed. It looked like and improved Firefox but now I&#8217;ve just logged into my blog and the rust started to show. Basically, in the admin panel of wordpress, everything is out of place and a real mess. Who is to blame? I have no clue. But all of this worked on Firefox&#8230;
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I think that the major advantage I have found so far is the fact that each tab runs on a different process, which is the way things should be. That way, when one page crashes, it isn&#8217;t your whole browser that goes down but just that very page. In a time where web exploits are at their peak, this is very important. Also kudos to the fact that you can easily detach tabs from a window into a separate window, and then add tabs to that window that you just created. It really is THAT easy!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The major disadvantage, is the fact that you can&#8217;t switch dictionaries quickly and conveniently from the context menu inside a &#8220;textarea&#8221; which you can do on Firefox. For someone who has to alternate between Portuguese and English dictionaries, this is a major turn-down. Specially because it seems that you even have to restart the browser for the changes to take effect. Bad, bad Google. What were you thinking?!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Other than this I have also loved the seamless integration with Windows Vista. Chrome just integrates much better on Vista&#8217;s look than Firefox does. Firefox barely supports transparency, whereas Chrome allows for transparency, even on the zone where the tabs reside.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In a nutshell, it&#8217;s still a beta version, and that does show. Try it at your own peril, but try it nonetheless. I think you will be impressed.
