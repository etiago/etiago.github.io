A great deal of people seem to land in my blog searching for the plans for building a Musical Tesla Coil. Therefore, I decided to do some researching myself and I am posting here my findings. I hope you find them useful ðŸ™‚

  Update: So apparently I still get loads of hits from people trying to get their hands on the schematics for Tesla Coils. I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t help you much on <strong>musical</strong> Tesla coils, but here&#8217;s a great website that describes all that you need to know to build just a funky Tesla coil: <a href="http://www.alansharp.co.uk/homepage.htm">http://www.alansharp.co.uk/homepage.htm</a> &#8211; now, go crazy! If you manage to build one, be sure to come back here and post an image. If you post one on the comments zone, I&#8217;ll incorporate it into the post ðŸ™‚
