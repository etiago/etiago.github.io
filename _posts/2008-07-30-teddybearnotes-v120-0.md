  <p>
    New version release. This version includes both bug-fixes and improvements, refer to the change-log for a detailed overview of such changes.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Change-Log:<br />&#8211; Bug-Fix: If you had TeddyBearNotes keeping your window always open, when you shut-down your computer or simply close TBNotes, the notes would not be saved. They are now.<br />&#8211; Behaviour change: If you had TBNotes auto-hiding the window when it would lose focus, whenever you would click on the icon to get the window to open again your text cursor would be <span style="font-weight: bold;">behind</span> the text already on the note window, whereas now, the cursor shows up on front of all the text present in the box, allowing you to start typing right away.
