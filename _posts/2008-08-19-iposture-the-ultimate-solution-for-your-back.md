  This discreet little gadget promises to straighten up your back from that weird slouching position that we all unconsciously acquire at some point. Be it because you spend too much time sitting or because you are a more direct relative to the apes, you will notice that your back is slightly curved at times. This is usually accompanied by your shoulders dropping down and pointing forward.
