  Yep, that is right indeed, I have one of such babies. Privileges of being a Microsoft Student Partner huh? It does have its downturns as well though, such as when I go out of my house, there&#8217;s a massive crowd waiting to get my autograph and to interview me&#8230; (not really&#8230;)

  But that&#8217;s just it, just wanted to share my shiny new subscriptor card with you readers and have you envy it. Yes, now I have Vista Ultimate for free, and who knows, maybe Windows 7 too, when it gets out&#8230; ðŸ˜‰

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  My apologies for having gone through a period without posting at all but, my life has been undergoing some maintenance (all for good, I assure you! but won&#8217;t get into specifics) and therefore I haven&#8217;t been coming here as often as I would like. This is however going to change and so, expect to see more regular posting from now on.

  See you soon!
