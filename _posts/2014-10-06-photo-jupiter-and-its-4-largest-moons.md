  As some of you may know, I have recently taken up a new hobby. I started with (very) amateur astronomy. Now while the Dutch skies are not the best for astronomy due to having <a href="http://uk.arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0108052"><em>the</em>Â worst</a> light pollutionÂ in Europe (probably due to its extensive greenhouses and the artificial lightning they require), it&#8217;s still possible to see the closer objects to Earth such as the planets in our own solar system.

  While I had seen Jupiter in multiple occasions before, as it is visible with the naked eye, seeing its four largest moons live (Europa, Io, Ganymede and Callisto) was definitely a first for me. Believe me when I say that the photograph does not do justice to the real thing and it is indeed a pity. The photo has been taken last Sunday morning (October 5th 2014 at 6:40am, before the sunrise as Jupiter then becomes invisible due to the sunlight) with my Canon EOS 550D attached to my telescope via a T2 adapter especially tailored for Canon DSLRs. While this adapter does wonders compared to aligning a mobile phone camera with the eye piece, it also attaches directly to the telescope and thus, takes no advantage of any lens-enabling magnification.

  The result is what you see below. I&#8217;ve cropped the photos to show only the section where Jupiter and its moons are. Despite not being as good as looking at it through a 10mm lens on a 3x Barlow (totaling a 400x zoom), it&#8217;s still quite a sight ðŸ™‚ .

  Keep scrolling for the photos and until the next time!
