  <p>
    This version is just a hotfix for a bug (this time on Vista) that was introduced with the last version. The bug would make TeddyBear Notes crash on Startup, should that option be enabled. Updatting is recommended.

    Change Log:<br />&#8211; Bug fix: The «Startup Path» for the shortcut that is put in place for automatic startup was including the filename in the path, which would lead to Windows Vista (it was not tested on XP but it is likely that the problem is also replicable there) to close TeddyBear Notes.</div>
