That&#8217;s right, this will after all be the official name of the next Windows version. According to Mike Nash on the Windows Vista <a href="http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2008/10/13/introducing-windows-7.aspx" target="_blank">blog</a>, Microsoft is sticking with the simple name Windows 7, therefore cutting with the &#8220;aspirational monikers&#8221; that they have used in the past like Windows XP or Vista.

The same person writes that this is the seventh release of Windows, hence the naming Windows 7.

Another <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3777686" target="_blank">source</a> tells us that a pre-beta version of this new Windows will be distributed at the Professional Developer Conference, set to take place on Los Angeles on October 27th.
