  Soooo&#8230; apparently Mac&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3Z386vXrt4" target="_blank">can&#8217;t catch viruses</a> but the iPhone certainly can. There is a flaw in the iPhone&#8217;s software that allows any attacker to gain complete control over your phone. Flaw which Apple is aware of but still hasn&#8217;t patched. The details are simple and as such I will cut to the chase: if you receive an SMS with a single square in it, by the love of God &#8211; <strong>TURN OFF YOUR PHONE</strong>.

  You have been warned, be safe, buy a Palm Pr√©.
