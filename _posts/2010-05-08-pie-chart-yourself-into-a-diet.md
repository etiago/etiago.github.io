  Pretty much everyone who could actually use with a diet has problems with it. They either don&#8217;t know how much they should be eating of each of the different types of food, or they simply shun the idea out of their minds when push comes to shove. With this in mind, a very clever Portuguese guy and some other people (nationality bias much? ðŸ™‚ ) came up with this plate that has a wheel of nutrition drawn on it.

  This way, you will not only know exactly how much you should be eating of each of the wheel&#8217;s categories, but you will also feel guilt ridden if your t-bone steak occupies the whole vegetable and cereal sections. These plates are apparently still just a proof of concept, but I&#8217;m pretty sure you can even photoshop the wheels yourself and have them transferred into normal white plates.
