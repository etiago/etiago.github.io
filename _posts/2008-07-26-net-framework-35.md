<div style="text-align: justify;">
  A friend of mine pointed out that TBNotes&#8217; installer will report that the .NET Framework 3.5 is not installed, but a place to where download it from is not provided with it. Therefore, I decided to make a post with the links for downloading the framework:</p> 
  
  <p>
    &#8211; If you have Internet access where you want to install the framework, then download <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/info.aspx?na=90&p=&SrcDisplayLang=en&SrcCategoryId=&SrcFamilyId=333325fd-ae52-4e35-b531-508d977d32a6&u=http%3a%2f%2fdownload.microsoft.com%2fdownload%2f7%2f0%2f3%2f703455ee-a747-4cc8-bd3e-98a615c3aedb%2fdotNetFx35setup.exe">this</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8211; As an alternative, you can download the full thing <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/0/f/60fc5854-3cb8-4892-b6db-bd4f42510f28/dotnetfx35.exe">here</a> which is a bigger download and it installs the .NET Framework 3.5 without requiring Internet access at the target computer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Keep in mind: if you do have Internet access, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">first option</span> is the indicated for your needs as it will only download the necessary files.</div>
