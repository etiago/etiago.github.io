  Well, for some weird reason, Apple refuses to give in and have Adobe port Flash over to the iPhone. It would be a massive advantage if we could see an iPhone with a full blown version of Flash, as opposed to Flash Lite. But&#8230; Apple won&#8217;t bend. So what does Apple do? The best it can do right now: get people angry at Apple.
