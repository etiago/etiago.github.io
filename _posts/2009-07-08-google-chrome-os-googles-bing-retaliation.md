  Just a few hours ago Google has announced it will be entering the operating system market. The contestant? Google Chrome OS.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Google&#8217;s goals seem to be speed and simplicity, although it remains unclear where they want to go with this. They go as far as stating that if you spend most of your time on the web, then Chrome OS is for you but this is all still too blurry. Will this be an actual operating system that lives outside the browser? Or is this some sort of mock-up of an operating system that you get in your browser? If it is the first, then I have a hard time finding true utility for it &#8211; a computer that can only browse the net? *Skepticism alert*

  The time frame? Second half of 2010. Hit up the links below for more info:
