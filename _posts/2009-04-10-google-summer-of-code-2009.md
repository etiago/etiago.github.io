I know this post comes a little late and all but I still had to mention it on my blog. It turns out I am repeating the stunt again. After being turned down by Google last year, I decided I would try to apply once more this year.

Since last year I still had the change to get acquainted and get the logic of <a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/" target="_blank">Apache Derby</a>, I thought it would be wise to apply for the same project, and so I did. After all I do have an education on database management and also on Java, which are key for a project like Apache Derby. On top of it all there&#8217;s also my tutor from last year; despite not having been chosen I still had a tutor who helped me all the way through. Kathey Marsden agreed to be my tutor again this year and that is a plus for me because I know upfront what I can expect.

So, the application period is over and my application is submitted. The results should be out on April 20th and I have my fingers crossed for me to get picked ðŸ™‚
