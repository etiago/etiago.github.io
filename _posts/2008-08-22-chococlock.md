  <img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-58" style="border: 1px solid #000000; margin: 2px; float: left;" title="p1818h" src="https://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/p1818h.gif" alt="" width="120" height="130" />Well, okay this is a very weird and useless gadget but if your girlfriend is suffering from anorexia and you have no clue what to give her on her birthday, here&#8217;s the ideal gift!

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  So what is it actually? It&#8217;s basically a &#8220;cuckoo-clock&#8221; that will release a chocolate every hour. Truth to be told, it is kind of dodgy that there is only a pink version of it. However, it is also the kind of gadget that simply does not work for people like me, since it actually has a button that allows you to cheat.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I wonder if there would be any chocolate left to dispense as soon as the hour mark came&#8230;
