  Well, I could not have better news today: I was accepted into Microsoft&#8217;s Student Partner Program! Out of the initial 30 students who had been called for an interview in Lisbon, 20 of us got picked and I am amongst those 20.

  The thrill starts right away in September, month on which we were asked to not make any plans for either the first nor the last weekend. I&#8217;m still a little bit on the dark, regarding what&#8217;s happening and where but we were promised more news soon, so I can but to wait to hear more from the people in charge. I&#8217;ll post here when I know more.
