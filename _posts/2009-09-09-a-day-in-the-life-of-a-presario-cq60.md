My owner won&#8217;t leave me alone for a second during the day! I&#8217;m surprised he gave me some rest now, I guess I should enjoy it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Well, first things first so I should introduce myself. I&#8217;m an HP Compaq Presario CQ60-200EP and by the looks of it, I must be pretty darn good as my owner uses me every single day! It can be maddening at times&#8230; having him (literally) push my buttons all the time&#8230;
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Lately he&#8217;s done a smart move though and installed Windows 7 on me. I feel so much lighter now. It&#8217;s as if I went to the gym regularly for a year&#8230; except I didn&#8217;t!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I don&#8217;t get to do much fun stuff very often but he does a lot of work with me and in a way I&#8217;m happy with that. I like feeling useful and handy and I know my owner trusts me with some pretty serious stuff&#8230;
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I pack a generous 15.6 inch screen which is pretty wide and still portable (in your face, you 17 inch monsters!). All in all I was very affordable and I&#8217;m a dual core, from Intel &#8211; by far the best CPU maker out there right now. My graphics are also by Nvidia which is pretty darn good, I say. You know, I also have a DVD burner with lightscribe which is the next best thing these days and did I mention that I have an integrated card-reader, a webcam and an HDMI output?! I love it when he plugs me in to his 52 inch flat screen. I feel like a whole different computer when he watches 1080p movies with me!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Do you need a laptop? If you do, I have a few brothers that would gladly live with you and accompany you everywhere! I&#8217;m a sexy piano-black and have a cute aluminum &#8220;Q&#8221; on my lid. Interested? Well, for a limited period I can get you $30 off in orders over $150 on the HP Home Store. Sounds good?
