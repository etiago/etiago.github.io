<p>
I've been meaning to come back to blogging more frequently, but the whole set up that the blog requires was putting me off.
</p>

<p>
Just as it happens, I've recently gotten into Emacs and the whole org-mode cult, and naturally, started trying to do everything on emacs :-).
</p>

<p>
One of the things I came across, was an approach to write Jekyll posts by using an org file to fill in the contents, which is exactly how this blog post was written.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully this will make it easier for me to come back to a more regular blogging cadence.
</p>

<p>
Time will tell!
