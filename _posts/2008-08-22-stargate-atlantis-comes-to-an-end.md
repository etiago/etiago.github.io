  Those of you who know me well, know that I am an avid fan of everything that is Stargate related. Yes, I watched the whole 10 seasons of Stargate SG-1 and I have followed every single episode of Stargate Atlantis so far. It is simply a show I cannot get enough of.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Still, the tv network SciFi seems to be determined in upsetting me and all the Stargate fans out there. First they pulled the plug on SG-1 and now, they <a href="http://www.tv.com/story/11569.html?tag=topslot;link;1&om_act=convert&om_clk=topslot" target="_blank">decide to do the same</a> on Atlantis&#8217; , as soon as its fifth season ends. What are the true space fans supposed to watch now?! Battlestar Galactica? I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;m a little over sneaky women in red dresses, and the whole worthless drama surrounding that tv series which was so promising to start with.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Well, not all hope is lost though&#8230; Apparently a new Stargate series is on the making, this one of its name Stargate Universe. According to <a href="http://www.tv.com/story/11571.html?tag=topslot;link;0&om_act=convert&om_clk=topslot" target="_blank">tv.com</a> this new series will be about a ¬´a group of explorers board an abandoned, Ancients-built starship called The Destiny¬ª *raise eyebrow*. I was a little bit excited at the prospect of a new Stargate series since I had known about it for a while, but what I did not expect was the sudden decision of shutting down Atlantis &#8211; now, with this information regarding Universe, my skepticism is through the roof. A Stargate series without travelling through Stargates? Err&#8230; is it me or something does not match?
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Unless of course, The Destiny is small enough to fit into the Stargate, but then it is most likely a puddle-jumper, and that would be utterly boring. Maybe I&#8217;m being too harsh but I think that SciFi is inevitably killing the original spirit of the Stargate. Give us something new, but not <em>that</em> new&#8230;
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  On the streak of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">good news</span> reasonable news is the fact that the Stargate fans will also have the MMORPG game coming out relatively soon. Once again however, the game isn&#8217;t overly based on the tv show and whilst I am excited to try it out, I&#8217;m also taking it with a grain of salt.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  According to an <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/stargateworlds/news.html?sid=6184182&mode=previews" target="_blank">interview</a> carried out by GameSpot, it seems that Stargate Worlds will actually be some sort of World of Stargate.

>   This means we can&#8217;t keep retelling the story of <em>SG-1</em>. We&#8217;re going to let players choose from seven archetypes&#8211;Jaffa, Goa&#8217;uld, Asgard, and human soldier, scientist, archeologist, and commando&#8211;when they create a character.

  Ah well, thank you SciFi for killing my inner-child üôÅ
