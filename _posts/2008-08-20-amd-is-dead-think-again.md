  So you thought AMD was dead? Well that is not what <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/Atom-Athlon-Efficient,1997.html" target="_blank">this</a> review by Tom&#8217;s Hardware shows us. It is true that the Core 2 platform has <a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=12061" target="_blank">smashed</a> the competition from AMD on pretty much every front of the market, but this tide might be about to turn.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  With the recent <a href="http://www.crn.com.au/News/81629,netbook-sales-to-soar-in-2008.aspx" target="_blank">outbreak of netbook computers</a> like the Asus Eee PC, it leaves us to wonder where the big bucks might be coming from in the near future. Perhaps with this in mind, AMD downclocked and undervolted its Athlon64 segment to start headbutting with Intel&#8217;s Atom architecture. Truth to be told, they apparently succeeded on creating a platform that outperforms Atom on efficiency, where as by efficiency we understand processing capacity over power consumed. Actually, the Athlon64 2000+ runs at lower a frequency than Intel&#8217;s counterpart, but as we have seen in the past, when it comes to getting the most out of the same frequency, AMD is on top due to their more efficient architecture. This said, not only the A64 runs at a lower frequency, but it also does outperform Intel&#8217;s Atom CPU.

  Personally, on a time where the dillema is what Intel CPU to choose rather than to choose between Intel and AMD, and being on a stalemate because of it, I think this is nothing but good news. Not only for AMD themselves but for the market in general, because we all know what happens when companies monopolize markets, right?
