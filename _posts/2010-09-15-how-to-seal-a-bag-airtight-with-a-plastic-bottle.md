This technique teaches you how to seal a bag, in a airtight manner, with nothing but a&#8230;. plastic bottle!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Yes, my description was dramatically exaggerated. This is just one of those cool DIY things that most people don&#8217;t think about, but hopefully, after reading this article, you&#8217;ll remember it next time you need to seal a bag.

  Read on if I got your attention.<!--more-->

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  So here&#8217;s what you&#8217;re going to need:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  1. Plastic bottle, any size will do.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  2. Plastic bag &#8211; obviously it cannot have any holes on it or this trick won&#8217;t work.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  3. Pair of scissors &#8211; preferably ones with sharp, pointy tips. This will make it easier for you.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  After you have obtained these tools, you start by cutting the &#8220;mouth&#8221; of the bottle off. You have to cut a little bit under where you screw the cap, so that on one end you have the mouth-less bottle and on the other, you have just the mouth with a little bit of plastic attached to it &#8211; just like on the image:

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <a href="http://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/image001.jpeg"></a>At this point you should have separated these two parts of the bottle and now is when the &#8220;magic&#8221; begins. In actual fact, you just need the mouthpiece, you can throw away the rest or fancy a vase out of it. With the mouthpiece, you unscrew the cap, pass the open part of the bag through the mouth of the bottle and apply the cap over the plastic bag, thus sealing it shut. Here&#8217;s an image explaining showing the end result:

    Now you can store awayÂ your peanuts and they&#8217;ll never go soggy again!
