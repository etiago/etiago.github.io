Yep, the title says it all. Today I have received my shiny new VISA from Citibank with the initial $505 loaded on it. The other kewl stuff in the envelope included a neat, Google-branded, moleskin and two GSoC 2009 stickers. One&#8217;s going on my laptop, if I can gut it!

Well, I&#8217;ll leave you with some photos now!
