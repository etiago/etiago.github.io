  So on my last blog post I mentioned how AMD isn&#8217;t sleeping, and how it had released a low-power version of their Athlon64 CPU, the 2000+ to go head-to-head with Intel&#8217;s Atom processor. Well as it turns out, Intel certainly hadn&#8217;t given its last word on the subject.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Perhaps in the light of <a href="http://www.tiagoespinha.net/2008/08/amd-is-dead-think-again/" target="_self">AMD&#8217;s move</a> on the low-end market, Intel decided that the release of the dual-core version of the Atom processor, the Atom 330, will occur sooner than expected.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Our sources tell us that this chip will run at the frequency of 1.6Ghz and it will have a total L2 cache of 1Mb (512Kb per core) and it will run on the same 533Mhz bus as its single-core counterpart (N270). It is expected that the Atom 330 will be significantly faster than the Atom 230 which was trampled by Via&#8217;s Nano according to a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/hardware/atom-nano-review.ars" target="_blank">review</a> by Ars Technica.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  It is also worth mentioning that both cores on Atom 330 will have the HyperThreading technology and as a result, the operating system will have 4 virtual cores at its disposal. It needs to be noted that this HT technology was dropped in the Core platform and it&#8217;s now being brought back to life on both the Atom and <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/hardware/0,1000000091,39286539,00.htm" target="_blank">Nehalem architectures</a>. Rumour went that this technology was dropped because it was ineffective and in some cases it would even draw more power than a dual-CPU solution, so we can only hope that Intel knows what they are doing.
