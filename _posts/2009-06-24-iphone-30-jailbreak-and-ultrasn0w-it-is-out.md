  It might be old news for some, but I am sure that not everyone is aware of this yet.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The good folks at the <a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/" target="_blank">iPhone Dev Team</a> did it again and after some days that just seemed too long, they released the new tool called redsn0w. This tool is meant to jailbreak the iPhone 3G <strong>only</strong>, and only with the firmware 3.0 &#8211; jailbreak for the 3GS still hasn&#8217;t been released but since the flaw seems to exist in the 3G, it should only be a matter of days (and of the Dev Team getting their hands on a 3GS &#8211; feel free to <a href="http://widget.chipin.com/widget/id/0c9fb4b8bbe38374" target="_blank">chip in</a>) until the jailbreak is released.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The process is pretty simple, just update to 3.0 normally through iTunes and when that&#8217;s done, search for the correct IPSW in the following folder (if you&#8217;re using Vista or 7):<br /> C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\iTunes\iPhone Software Updates<br /> (For XP, search around the Application Data folders under Documents and Settings)
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  When you have this file, just feed it to redsn0w and follow the steps. In under 5 minutes you should be running a jailbroken 3.0.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  After this is done, if you also want to operator-unlock your phone, you&#8217;ll need ultrasn0w. This is the replacement for the long-lived yellowsn0w. In case you weren&#8217;t aware of this fact, the new baseband has a hole again, which allows for it to be hacked. This way, we can all use different operator SIM cards without a problem.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  To install ultrasn0w, you simply need to add the repo http://repo666.ultrasn0w.com and then search and install the application ultrasn0w on Cydia. Reboot your phone, and you&#8217;re done. It really is THAT easy!

  So what are you waiting for? Go for it!
