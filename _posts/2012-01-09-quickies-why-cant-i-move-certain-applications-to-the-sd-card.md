Following up on the previous &#8220;quickies&#8221; format, I decided to answer a question that goes unanswered through a quick Google search. This quickie has to do with the _Android OS_ platform.

**Question**: Why can&#8217;t I move certain applications to the SD card?

**Answer**: The &#8220;move to SD card&#8221; feature of Android MUST be explicitly enabled by the developers of each application. This is the reason why for some apps, the &#8220;move to SD card&#8221; button is greyed out.

Hope that helps anyone who&#8217;s ever asked Google this question!
