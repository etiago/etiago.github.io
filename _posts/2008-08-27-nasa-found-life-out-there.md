  No, not really. It is actually just an earthling virus that made it to outer space, and it isn&#8217;t even a real living virus, it&#8217;s a computer virus.

  Disappointed? Don&#8217;t be. It is still pretty cool how something like this can happen. According to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7583805.stm" target="_blank">BBC News</a> the virus made it to the International Space Station through laptops used by astronauts. Luckily these laptops aren&#8217;t mission-critical and apparently there is no permanent Internet link on the ISS, and all data exchanged with Earth is actually scanned first. Disappointed even further? Seriously, don&#8217;t be. Someone was dumb enough to get their USB pen drives infected with viruses and further on to use them on orbit, without having checked it for virus or anything.

  Looks like NASA should include a few basic computer security classes on their astronaut training&#8230;
