  Alright people, this is really happening ðŸ˜€ . Today, I got the final acceptance letter from Leicester&#8217;s Postgraduate Department. They provided me with a conditional offer where the only condition is that I finish my degree with at least 65% of overall grade average. This is totally feasible since my grade average, last I checked, was of 14 marks in a 20-point scale, which rounds to roughly 70% in a loose conversion.

  Cool, hey? ðŸ˜€ Now let&#8217;s just hope those money leechs at the bank will loan me the money I need!

  Just on a little background, I&#8217;ll be taking the Advanced Software Engineering (MSc) course at the University of Leicester, with a start date of September 28th 2009. When I&#8217;m done, I&#8217;ll finally be a jack of all trades and a Master of Advanced Software Engineering ðŸ™‚
