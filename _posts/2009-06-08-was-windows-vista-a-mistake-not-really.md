  With the advent of Microsoft&#8217;s latest operating system, the Windows 7, many people have come to state that Windows 7 is Windows Vista <a href="http://jmm.aaa.net.au/articles/22533.htm" target="_blank">done</a> <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/biztech/windows-7-its-vista-done-right/2009/05/04/1241289099764.html" target="_blank">right</a>. Well, excuse me tech whizzes but as an IT professional myself, I beg to differ.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Windows Vista was a massive stepping stone in Microsoft&#8217;s history. It was the first upgrade from the ever so loved Windows XP, that admittedly had its flaws at birth but it grew to become perhaps the most stable operating system that Microsoft had built until then. It is lightweight and to prove that we have the netbook market share that is dominated by Microsoft.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Now, we have to be analytic. What did Vista bring to the table when compared to XP? In a very brief and sketchy approach, it brought cleanliness to the user folders (no one really liked the spaces in &#8216;Documents and Settings&#8217;), it brought UAC that albeit poorly-loved, it brought with it a great layer of security, it brought some driver modifications including a redesigned sound-stack and these last two put together with the bloated memory usage, made Vista Microsoft&#8217;s bastard child.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Well, when you look at it closely, pretty much every Vista driver will work on Windows 7, including the soundcard drivers. UAC is also part of Windows 7 and has been partly redesigned so that it isn&#8217;t so naggy. Still, my bottom line is that when switching from XP, Microsoft was always going to get complaints. When you add security, people will complain because the system is more restrictive. When you add features that change the way people interface with the computer, people will complain because we have an inertial nature and are typically against change.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  However, now that Vista was Microsoft&#8217;s escape goat for all the changes that simply had to be made, Windows 7 can come in its shinning armour and save the day. Because Windows 7 is so much better than Vista, even though it&#8217;s actually Vista, just lighter.
