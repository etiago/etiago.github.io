  Well, truth to be told this had to happen at some point. According to the good folks at <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/10/t-mobile-we-probably-lost-all-your-sidekick-data/" target="_blank">Engadget</a>, T-Mobile has most probably lost the data of their customers&#8217; Sidekick phones. The T-Mobile Sidekick is a device that relies heavily on cloud-computing and simple things such as looking up contacts or reading old text messages are done through servers in the cloud (that is to say, in the Internet). So if these servers fail for some reason, or more extremely (like it happened) lose all the data they contain, then the end user is pretty much screwed.

  I hope for the sake of the costumers that the data isn&#8217;t just lost; I would have also hoped that T-Mobile had off-site, offline backups of all this stuff but that clearly does not seem to be the case. It is also up to our imagination whom to blame for this. Of course that for all the people affected by this problem, T-Mobile will be the one to blame, but whose fault was it in the end? Is it a bug in the servers? Will it happen again? Has it been patched?

  Doesn&#8217;t really matter now but here&#8217;s the morale of the story: <strong>ALWAYS </strong>keep backups of your data.
