  As soon as I picked up on Turmeric SOA as the engine that powers my research, one of my supervisors warned me: be careful, or you&#8217;ll be caught in technology hell. As much as I hate to admit it, this has inevitably happened. The point is&#8230; I&#8217;m using Turmeric SOA which is open-source and open-source is great for research. Everything is so open that I can afford to publish literally everything I do. This means that all the claims I make with my research can be easily verified independently by other researchers.

  I love this transparency.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The problem comes when the transparency is the result of emptiness. More specifically, Turmeric SOA is open but its documentation lacks vastly. In the inception of its open-sourcing by Intalio, Inc. their software engineers were working night and day to adapt the wiki pages (which apparently are the only public form of documentation) from mentioning &#8220;EBAY&#8221; to mentioning &#8220;TURMERIC&#8221;. However, as the dust began to settle and eBay decided to go in-house with the open-sourcing, the work done on Turmeric SOA has greatly diminished and what once was a promising open project is now a graveyard. eBay&#8217;s software engineers keep a low key and aren&#8217;t exactly supportive of other people using Turmeric SOA which is very disappointing. It seems common sense that if a project is open-sourced, the main goal should be for it to get a large user-base. The more people contributing and using a piece of software, the more ideas and bugs will be found and thus, the more refined the project will become.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This has not happened. As an outsider, eBay&#8217;s stance on open-source seems that of a beach-goer who&#8217;s too afraid to go for a dive and instead just keeps probing the water with their toes. This is bad. It&#8217;s bad for eBay because it will inevitably taint their reputation with open-source, it&#8217;s bad for the community who now get a half-baked services platform and it&#8217;s bad more specifically for me. Now I have to deal with a promising but ultimately difficult to use platform. Most everything I do with Turmeric SOA requires copious amounts of manual debugging in order to figure out what&#8217;s happening and ultimately, these debugging sessions reveal that what was advertised as a feature, really isn&#8217;t one.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In sum, the lesson learned is: be wary of large open-source projects. Unless there is a strong community around it, you&#8217;re gonna have a real tough time.
