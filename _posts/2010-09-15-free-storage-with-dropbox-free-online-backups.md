  <a href="https://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/dropbox.png" rel="lightbox[412]" title="dropbox"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-413" title="dropbox" src="https://www.tiagoespinha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/dropbox.png" alt="" width="127" height="127" /></a>If you need a way to store your files in a manner that they are always accessible everywhere, then Dropbox is for you. In case you haven&#8217;t yet heard about this service, then know that Dropbox offers you 2Gb for free to store whichever files you like. The guys at Dropbox also have a software that integrates nicely with Windows and Mac OS and you can even access the files from your iPhone or Android powered phone.

  You might think that 2Gb are rather meager and you are right, that&#8217;s nothing these days. This is why Dropbox has an awesome <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTU5NzI4OQ" target="_blank">referral program</a> that will allow you to go up to 10Gb just by referring friends! That&#8217;s right, 10Gb for free just by referring Dropbox to a few friends.

  If you are up for it, Dropbox also offers paid plans where you can pay $9.99 a month for 50Gb of storage or you can go the extra mile and pay $19.99 for the 100Gb service. Still, if this is a little too extreme for you, register an account (with <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTU5NzI4OQ" target="_blank">my referral</a>, obviously :)) and start spamming referring friends with your link!
