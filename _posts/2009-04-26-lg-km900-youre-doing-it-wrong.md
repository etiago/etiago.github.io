As the newest [LG KM900](http://uk.lge.com/products/model/detail/mobilephones_lgarena(km900).jhtml) is released, I can&#8217;t help the thought: LG, you&#8217;re doing it wrong.

Honestly, I do not feel motivated to write about this phone simply because it is not aimed at mainstream; whoever tells me otherwise is clearly missing on the whole point. Put it this way, a phone isn&#8217;t really just a phone anymore these days. The market requires customisable and flexible phones, such phones that can be expanded. What is the point of having a next-gen, touch-screen phone if afterwards you can&#8217;t extend it with third-party applications and functionality?

In my humble opinion, it is safe to say that nowadays, a phone without:

1) Windows Mobile
  
or
  
2) Symbian OS
  
or
  
3) iPhone OS

is just doomed to extinction and failure. I know I wouldn&#8217;t buy anything outside that. (I am a proud owner of an iPhone 3G by the way)
