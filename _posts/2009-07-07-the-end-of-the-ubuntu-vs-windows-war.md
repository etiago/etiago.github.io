  YAY!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Christopher Dawnson over at <a href="http://education.zdnet.com/?p=2770&tag=nl.e550" target="_blank">ZDNet</a> has announced the end of the Ubuntu vs. Windows war, the world is safe again!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Till the next time!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  WAIT! Hold it!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  What the heck?! Wasn&#8217;t ZDNet supposed to be a reliable source of information regarding technology? So what are these shenanigans about his 17 year old saying that they&#8217;re the same? I&#8217;ll tell you what it is: it is the most bold statement I&#8217;ve heard all year, and also the most idiotic one. So just because a 17 year old says that they&#8217;re the same, 6 billion people will just agree and this fact will just be set in stone? Bullshit.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Windows and Linux are different; it&#8217;s about time people realize that. I absolutely need both so is this proof enough that they are ultimately different?

  Christopher says: &#8220;Their underlying architectures are quite a bit different, Gnome looks different than the 7 UI, etc.&#8221;. The underlying architectures are quite a bit different, Gnome looks different than 7 does, but apart from that, which by the way is everything that effing matters in an Operating System, they&#8217;re pretty much the same.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I have a Hyundai Getz, my neighbour has a Ferrari, but apart from the engine and the chassis they&#8217;re pretty much the same. They both have wheels! A whole set of four! So they must be the same&#8230;

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Come on guys&#8230; get serious.
