<div style="text-align: justify;">
  Here I am again talking about Google Code Jam, unfortunately not with good news. üôÅ</p> 
  
  <p>
    That is right, I managed to successfully solve a small data set for one of Code Jam&#8217;s problems but not only did I take a very long time to do so, the large data set was also wrong. This said, at the end I did not have the enough points to get through to the next round and I am out.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a way I am glad that I did not pass&#8230; I was getting an headache after each round, and that&#8217;s something I can do without.
