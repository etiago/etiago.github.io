I've been meaning to come back to blogging more frequently, but the whole set up that the blog requires was putting me off.

Just as it happens, I've recently gotten into Emacs and the whole org-mode cult, and naturally, started trying to do everything on emacs :-).

One of the things I came across, was an approach to write Jekyll posts by using an org file to fill in the contents, which is exactly how this blog post was written.

Hopefully this will make it easier for me to come back to a more regular blogging cadence.

Time will tell!
